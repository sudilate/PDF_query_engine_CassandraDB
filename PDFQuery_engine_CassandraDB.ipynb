Using Kali Linux, \\nan advanced penetration testing distribution of Linux, \\nyou’ll learn the basics of using the Linux operating \\nsystem and acquire the tools and techniques you’ll \\nneed to take control of a Linux environment.\\nFirst, you’ll learn how to install Kali on a virtual machine \\nand get an introduction to basic Linux concepts. Next, \\nyou’ll tackle broader Linux topics like manipulating text, \\ncontrolling file and directory permissions, and managing \\nuser environment variables. You’ll then focus in on foun -\\ndational hacking concepts like security and anonymity \\nand learn scripting skills with bash and Python. \\nPractical tutorials and exercises throughout will reinforce \\nand test your skills as you learn how to:\\n• Cover your tracks by changing your network informa-\\ntion and manipulating the rsyslog logging utility\\n• Write a tool to scan for network connections, and \\nconnect and listen to wireless networks • Keep your internet activity stealthy using Tor, proxy \\nservers, VPNs, and encrypted email\\n• Write a bash script to scan open ports for potential \\ntargets\\n• Use and abuse services like MySQL, Apache web \\nserver, and OpenSSH\\n• Build your own hacking tools, such as a remote video \\nspy camera and a password cracker\\nHacking is complex, and there is no single way in. Why \\nnot start at the beginning with Linux Basics for Hackers?\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\nOccupyTheWeb is an infosec consultant, forensic \\ninvestigator, and trainer with more than 20 years in \\nthe industry. He maintains the Hackers-Arise training \\nsite (https://www.hackers-arise.com/ ) and trains US \\nmilitary personnel, Department of Defense contractors, \\nand federal employees in information security and \\nhacking.\\nwww.nostarch.comTHE FINEST IN GEEK ENTERTAINMENT™COVERS\\nKALI LINUX\\nAND PYTHON 3LINUX BASICS FOR HACKERSLINUX BASICS FOR HACKERSOCCUPYTHEWEBLINUX BASICS FOR HACKERSLINUX BASICS  \\nFOR HACKERS\\nGetting Started with  \\nNetworking, Scripting,  \\nand Security in Kali\\nby OccupyTheWeb\\nSan FranciscoLINUX BASICS FOR HACKERS.

Thank you.INTRODUCTION\\nHacking is the most important skill set of \\nthe 21st century! I don’t make that state -\\nment lightly. Events in recent years seem to \\nreaffirm this statement with every morning’s \\nheadline. Nations are spying on each other to gain \\nsecrets, cyber criminals are stealing billions of dollars, digital worms \\ndemanding ransoms are being released, adversaries are influencing each \\nother’s elections, and combatants are taking down each other’s utilities. \\nThese are all the work of hackers, and their influence over our increasingly \\ndigital world is just beginning to be felt.\\nI decided to write this book after working with tens of thousands of aspir -\\ning hackers through Null-Byte, https://www.hackers-arise.com/ , and nearly every \\nbranch of the US military and intelligence agencies (NSA, DIA, CIA, and \\nFBI). These experiences have taught me that many aspiring hackers have \\nhad little or no experience with Linux, and this lack of experience is the pri -\\nmary barrier to their starting the journey to becoming professional hackers. \\nAlmost all the best hacker tools are written in Linux, so some basic Linux \\nskills are a prerequisite to becoming a professional hacker. I have written this \\nbook to help aspiring hackers get over this barrier.xxii   IntroductionHacking is an elite profession within the IT field. As such, it requires an \\nextensive and detailed understanding of IT concepts and technologies. At \\nthe most fundamental level, Linux is a requirement. I strongly suggest you \\ninvest time and energy into using and understanding it if you want to make \\nhacking and information security your career.\\nThis book is not intended for the experienced hacker or the experienced \\nLinux admin. Instead, it is intended for those who want to get started along \\nthe exciting path of hacking, cybersecurity, and pentesting. It is also intended \\nnot as a complete treatise on Linux or hacking but rather a starting point \\ninto these worlds. It begins with the essentials of Linux and extends into \\nsome basic scripting in both bash and Python. Wherever appropriate, I have \\ntried to use examples from the world of hacking to teach Linux principles.\\nIn this introduction, we’ll look at the growth of ethical hacking for infor -\\nmation security, and I’ll take you through the process of installing a virtual \\nmachine so you can install Kali Linux on your system without disturbing the \\noperating system you are already running.\\nWhat’s in This Book\\nIn the first set of chapters you’ll  get comfortable with the fundamentals of \\nLinux; Chapter 1  will get you used to the file system and the terminal, and \\ngive you some basic commands. Chapter 2  shows you how to manipulate \\ntext to find, examine, and alter software and files. \\nIn Chapter 3  you’ll manage networks. You’ll scan for networks, find infor -\\nmation on connections, and disguise yourself by masking your network and \\nDNS information. \\nChapter 4  teaches you to add, remove, and update software, and how \\nto keep your system streamlined. In  Chapter 5 , you’ll manipulate file and \\ndirectory permissions to control who can access what. You’ll also learn some \\nprivilege escalation techniques. \\nChapter 6  teaches you how to manage services, including starting and \\nstopping processes and allocating resources to give you greater control. In \\nChapter 7  you’ll manage environment variables for optimal performance, \\nconvenience, and even stealth. You’ll find and filter variables, change your \\nPATH variable, and create new environment variables. \\nChapter 8  introduces you to bash scripting, a staple for any serious \\nhacker. You’ll learn the basics of bash and build a script to scan for target \\nports that you might later infiltrate.\\nChapters 9  and 10  give you some essential file system management skills, \\nshowing you how to compress and archive files to keep your system clean, \\ncopy entire storage devices, and get information on files and connected disks. \\nThe latter chapters dig deeper into hacking topics. In Chapter  11 you’ll \\nuse and manipulate the logging system to get information on a target’s activ -\\nity and cover your own tracks. Chapter 12  shows you how to use and abuse \\nthree core Linux services: Apache web server, OpenSSH, and MySQL. You’ll \\ncreate a web server, build a remote video spy, and learn about databases and \\ntheir vulnerabilities. Chapter 13  will show you how to stay secure and anony -\\nmous with proxy servers, the Tor network, VPNs, and encrypted email. Introduction   xxiiiChapter 14  deals with wireless networks. You’ll learn basic networking \\ncommands, then crack Wi-Fi access points and detect and connect to \\nBluetooth signals.\\nChapter 15  dives deeper into Linux itself with a high level view of how \\nthe kernel works and how its drivers can be abused to deliver malicious \\nsoftware. In Chapter 16  you’ll learn essential scheduling skills in order to \\nautomate your hacking scripts. Chapter 17  will teach you core Python con -\\ncepts, and you’ll script two hacking tools: a scanner to spy on TCP/IP con -\\nnections, and a simple password cracker.\\nWhat Is Ethical Hacking?\\nWith the growth of the information security field in recent years has come \\ndramatic growth in the field of ethical hacking, also known as white hat  \\n(good guy) hacking. Ethical hacking is the practice of attempting to infil -\\ntrate and exploit a system in order to find out its weaknesses and better \\nsecure it. I segment the field of ethical hacking into two primary compo -\\nnents: penetration testing for a legitimate information security firm and \\nworking for your nation’s military or intelligence agencies. Both are rapidly \\ngrowing areas, and demand is strong.\\nPenetration Testing\\nAs organizations become increasingly security conscious and the cost of \\nsecurity breaches rises exponentially, many large organizations are begin -\\nning to contract out security services. One of these key security services is \\npenetration testing. A penetration test  is essentially a legal, commissioned \\nhack to demonstrate the vulnerability of a firm’s network and systems.\\nGenerally, organizations conduct a vulnerability assessment first to find \\npotential vulnerabilities in their network, operating systems, and services. I \\nemphasize potential , as this vulnerability scan includes a significant number \\nof false positives (things identified as vulnerabilities that really are not). It is \\nthe role of the penetration tester to attempt to hack, or penetrate, these vul -\\nnerabilities. Only then can the organization know whether the vulnerability \\nis real and decide to invest time and money to close the vulnerability.\\nMilitary and Espionage\\nNearly every nation on earth now engages in cyber espionage and cyber war -\\nfare. One only needs to scan the headlines to see that cyber activities are the \\nchosen method for spying on and attacking military and industrial systems.\\nHacking plays a crucial part in these military and intelligence-gathering \\nactivities, and that will only be more true as time goes by. Imagine a war of \\nthe future where hackers can gain access to their adversary’s war plans and \\nknock out their electric grid, oil refineries, and water systems. These activities \\nare taking place every day now. The hacker thus becomes a key component of \\ntheir nation’s defense.xxiv   IntroductionWhy Hackers Use Linux\\nSo why do hackers use Linux over other operating systems? Mostly because \\nLinux offers a far higher level of control via a few different methods.\\nLinux Is Open Source\\nUnlike Windows, Linux is open source, meaning that the source code of the \\noperating system is available to you. As such, you can change and manipulate \\nit as you please. If you are trying to make a system operate in ways it was not \\nintended to, being able to manipulate the source code is essential.\\nLinux Is Transparent\\nTo hack effectively, you must know and understand your operating system \\nand, to a large extent, the operating system you are attacking. Linux is totally \\ntransparent, meaning we can see and manipulate all its working parts.\\nNot so with Windows. Microsoft tries hard to make it as difficult as \\npossible to know the inner workings of its operating systems, so you never \\nreally know what’s going on “under the hood,” whereas in Linux, you have \\na spotlight shining directly on each and every component of the operating \\nsystem. This makes working with Linux more effective.\\nLinux Offers Granular Control\\nLinux is granular. That means that you have an almost infinite amount of \\ncontrol over the system. In Windows, you can control only what Microsoft \\nallows you to control. In Linux, everything can be controlled by the terminal, \\nat the most miniscule level or the most macro level. In addition, Linux makes \\nscripting in any of the scripting languages simple and effective.\\nMost Hacking Tools Are Written for Linux\\nWell over 90 percent of all hacking tools are written for Linux. There are \\nexceptions, of course, such as Cain and Abel and Wikto, but those excep -\\ntions prove the rule. Even when hacking tools such as Metasploit or nmap \\nare ported for Windows, not all the capabilities transfer from Linux.\\nThe Future Belongs to Linux/Unix\\nThis might seem like a radical statement, but I firmly believe that the future \\nof information technology belongs to Linux and Unix systems. Microsoft \\nhad its day in the 1980s and 1990s, but its growth is slowing and stagnating.\\nSince the internet began, Linux/Unix has been the operating system \\nof choice for web servers due to its stability, reliability, and robustness. Even \\ntoday, Linux/Unix is used in two-thirds of web servers and dominates the \\nmarket. Embedded systems in routers, switches, and other devices almost \\nalways use a Linux kernel, and the world of virtualization is dominated by \\nLinux, with both VMware and Citrix built on the Linux kernel.\\nOver 80 percent of mobile devices run Unix or Linux (iOS is Unix, \\nand Android is Linux), so if you believe that the future of computing lies in Introduction   xxvmobile devices such as tablets and phones (it would be hard to argue other -\\nwise), then the future is Unix/Linux. Microsoft Windows has just 7 percent \\nof the mobile devices market. Is that the wagon you want to be hitched to?\\nDownloading Kali Linux\\nBefore getting started, you need to download and install Kali Linux on your \\ncomputer. This is the Linux distribution we will be working with throughout \\nthis book. Linux was first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as an open \\nsource alternative to Unix. Since it is open source, volunteer developers code \\nthe kernel, the utilities, and the applications. This means that there is no \\noverriding corporate entity overseeing development, and as a result, conven -\\ntions and standardization are often lacking.\\nKali Linux was developed by Offensive Security as a hacking operat -\\ning system built on a distribution of Linux called Debian. There are many \\ndistributions of Linux, and Debian is one of the best. You are probably most \\nfamiliar with Ubuntu as a popular desktop distribution of Linux. Ubuntu is \\nalso built on Debian. Other distributions include Red Hat, CentOS, Mint, \\nArch, and SUSE. Although they all share the same Linux kernel (the heart \\nof the operating system that controls the CPU, RAM, and so on), each has its \\nown utilities, applications, and choice of graphical interface (GNOME, KDE, \\nand others) for different purposes. As a result, each of these distributions of \\nLinux looks and feels slightly different. Kali was designed for penetration tes -\\nters and hackers and comes with a significant complement of hacking tools.\\nI strongly recommend that you use Kali for this book. Although you can \\nuse another distribution, you will likely have to download and install the \\nvarious tools we will be using, which could mean many hours downloading \\nand installing tools. In addition, if that distribution is not built on Debian, \\nthere may be other minor differences. You can download and install Kali \\nfrom https://www.kali.org/ .\\nFrom the home page, hover over the Downloads  link at the top of the \\npage and click Download Kali Linux . On the Downloads page you’ll be \\nfaced with multiple download choices. It’s important to choose the right \\ndownload. Along the left side of the table, you will see the image name , \\nwhich is the name of the version that the link downloads. For instance, \\nyou may see an image name called Kali Linux 64 Bit, meaning it’s the full \\nKali Linux and is suitable for 64-bit systems—most modern systems use a \\n64-bit Intel or AMD CPU. To determine what type of CPU is on your sys -\\ntem, go to Control Panel4System and Security 4System , and it should be \\nlisted. If your system is 64-bit, download and install the 64-bit version of \\nthe full Kali (not Light or Lxde, or any of the other alternatives).\\nIf you are running an older computer with a 32-bit CPU, you will need \\nto install the 32-bit version, which appears lower on the page.\\nYou have a choice of downloading via HTTP or Torrent. If you choose \\nHTTP, Kali will download directly to your system just like any download, and \\nit will be placed in your Downloads folder. The torrent download is the peer-to-  \\npeer download used by many file-sharing sites. You will need a torrenting xxvi   Introductionapplication like BitTorrent to do this. The Kali file will then download to the \\nfolder in which the torrenting application stores its downloads.\\nThere are other versions for other types of CPUs, such as the commonly \\nused ARM architecture found in so many mobile devices. If you are using a \\nRaspberry Pi, tablet, or other mobile device (phone users will likely prefer \\nKali NetHunter), make certain you download and install the ARM architec -\\nture version of Kali by scrolling down to Download ARM images and click -\\ning Kali ARM Images .\\nYou have Kali downloaded, but before you install anything, I want to \\ntalk a bit about virtual machines. Generally, for the beginner, installing \\nKali into a virtual machine is the best solution for learning and practicing.\\nVirtual Machines\\nVirtual machine (VM) technology allows you to run multiple operating \\nsystems from one piece of hardware like your laptop or desktop. This means \\nthat you can continue to run the Windows or MacOS operating system you \\nare familiar with and run a virtual machine of Kali Linux inside  that operat -\\ning system. You don’t need to overwrite your existing OS to learn Linux.\\nNumerous virtual machine applications are available from VMware, \\nOracle, Microsoft, and other vendors. All are excellent, but here I will be \\nshowing you how to download and install Oracle’s free VirtualBox .\\nInstalling VirtualBox\\nYou can download VirtualBox at https://www.virtualbox.org/ , as shown \\nin Figure 1. Click the Downloads  link in the left menu, and select the \\nVirtualBox package for your computer’s current operating system, which \\nwill host VirtualBox VM. Make sure to download the latest version.\\nFigure 1: VirtualBox home page\\nNOTE  These instructions were written with Windows in mind. If you’re using a Mac, the \\nprocess may be a little different, but you still should be able to follow along.Introduction   xxviiWhen the download has completed, click the setup file, and you will be \\ngreeted by a familiar Setup Wizard, shown in Figure 2. \\nFigure 2: The Setup Wizard dialog\\nClick Next , and you should be greeted with the Custom Setup screen, \\nas in Figure 3.\\nFigure 3: The Custom Setup dialog\\nFrom this screen, simply click Next . Keep clicking Next  until you get to \\nthe Network Interfaces warning screen and then click Yes.\\nClick Install  to begin the process. During this process, you will likely be \\nprompted several times about installing device software . These are the virtual \\nnetworking devices necessary for your virtual machines to communicate. \\nClick Install  for each one.\\nWhen the installation is complete, click Finish .xxviii   IntroductionSetting Up Your Virtual Machine\\nNow let’s get you started with your virtual machine. VirtualBox should open \\nonce it has installed—if not, open it—and you should be greeted by the \\nVirtualBox Manager, as seen in Figure 4.\\nFigure 4: The VirtualBox Manager\\nSince we will be creating a new virtual machine with Kali Linux, click \\nNew  in the upper-left corner. This opens the Create Virtual Machine dialog \\nshown in Figure 5.\\nGive your machine a name (any name is okay, but I simply used Kali) and \\nthen select Linux  from the Type  drop-down menu. Finally, select Debian \\n(64-bit)  from the third drop-down menu (unless you are using the 32-bit \\nversion of Kali, in which case select the Debian 32-bit version). Click Next , \\nand you’ll see a screen like Figure 6. Here, you need to select how much \\nRAM you want to allocate to this new virtual machine.\\nFigure 5: The Create Virtual Machine dialog\\n Figure 6: Allocating memoryIntroduction   xxixAs a rule of thumb, I don’t recommend using more than 25 percent of \\nyour total system RAM. That means if you have installed 4GB (or 4096MB) \\non your physical or host system, then select just 1GB for your virtual machine, \\nand if you have 16GB on your physical system, then select 4GB. The more \\nRAM you give your virtual machine, the better and faster it will run, but \\nyou must also leave enough RAM for your host operating system and any \\nother virtual machines you might want to run simultaneously. Your virtual \\nmachines will not use any RAM when you are not using them, but they will \\nuse hard drive space.\\nClick Next , and you’ll get to the Hard Disk screen. Choose Create \\nVirtual Hard Disk  and click Create . You should be asked which hard disk \\nfile type to use. Select the suggested default of VDI.\\nIn the next screen, you can decide whether you want the hard drive \\nyou are creating to be allocated dynamically or at a fixed size. If you choose \\nDynamically Allocated , the system will not take the entire maximum size you \\nallocate for the virtual hard disk until you need it, saving more unused hard \\ndisk space for your host system. I suggest you select dynamically allocated.\\nClick Next , and you’ll choose the amount of hard drive space to allo -\\ncate to the VM and the location of the VM (see Figure 7).\\nFigure 7: Allocating hard drive space\\nThe default is 8GB. I usually find that to be a bit small and recom -\\nmend that you allocate 20–25GB at a minimum. Remember, if you chose \\nto dynamically allocate hard drive space, it won’t use the space until you \\nneed it, and expanding your hard drive after it has already been allocated \\ncan be tricky, so better to err on the high side.\\nClick Create , and you’re ready to go!\\nInstalling Kali on the VM\\nAt this point, you should see a screen like Figure 8. Now you’ll need to \\ninstall Kali. Note that on the left of the VirtualBox Manager, you should \\nsee an indication that Kali VM is powered off. Click the Start  button \\n(green arrow icon).xxx   Introduction\\nFigure 8: The VirtualBox welcome screen\\nThe VirtualBox Manager will then ask where to find the startup disk. \\nYou’ve already downloaded a disk image with the extension .iso, which should \\nbe in your Downloads  folder (if you used a torrent to download Kali, the .iso \\nfile will be in the Downloads  folder of your torrenting application). Click the \\nfolder icon to the right, navigate to the Downloads  folder, and select the Kali \\nimage file (see Figure 9).\\nFigure 9: Selecting your startup diskIntroduction   xxxiThen click Start . Congratulations, you’ve just installed Kali Linux on a \\nvirtual machine!\\nSetting Up Kali\\nKali will now open a screen like Figure 10, offering you several startup \\nchoices. I suggest using the graphical install for beginners. Use your key -\\nboard keys to navigate the menu.\\nIf you get an error when you’re installing Kali into your VirtualBox, it’s \\nlikely because you don’t have virtualization enabled within your system’s \\nBIOS. Each system and its BIOS is slightly different, so check with your \\nmanufacturer or search online for solutions for your system and BIOS. In \\naddition, on Windows systems, you will likely need to disable any competing \\nvirtualization software such as Hyper-V. Again, an internet search for your \\nsystem should guide you in doing so.\\nFigure 10: Selecting the install method\\nYou will next be asked to select your language. Make certain you select \\nthe language you are most comfortable working in and then click Continue . \\nNext, select your location, click Continue , and then select your keyboard \\nlayout.\\nWhen you click Continue, VirtualBox will go through a process of detect -\\ning your hardware and network adapters. Just wait patiently as it does so. \\nEventually, you will be greeted by a screen asking you to configure your net -\\nwork, as in Figure 11.xxxii   Introduction\\nFigure 11: Entering a hostname\\nThe first item it asks for is the name of your host. You can name it any -\\nthing you please, but I left mine with the default “kali.”\\nNext, you will be asked for the domain name. It’s not necessary to \\nenter anything here. Click Continue . The next screen, shown in Figure 12, \\nis very important. Here, you are asked for the password you want to use \\nfor the root user.\\nFigure 12: Choosing a passwordIntroduction   xxxiiiThe root user in Linux is the all-powerful system administrator. You \\ncan use any password you feel secure with. If this were a physical system that \\nwe were using on the internet, I would suggest that you use a very long and \\ncomplex password to limit the ability of an attacker to crack it. Since this is \\na virtual machine that people can’t access without first accessing your host \\noperating system, password authentication on this virtual machine is less \\nimportant, but you should still choose wisely.\\nClick Continue , and you will be asked to set your time zone. Do so and \\nthen continue.\\nThe next screen asks about partition disks (a partition  is just what it \\nsounds like—a portion or segment of your hard drive). Choose Guided – \\nuse entire disk , and Kali will detect your hard drives and set up a parti -\\ntioner automatically.\\nKali will then warn you that all data on the disk you select will be \\nerased . . . but don’t worry! This is a virtual disk, and the disk is new and \\nempty, so this won’t actually do anything. Click Continue .\\nKali will now ask whether you want all files in one partition or if you \\nwant to have separate partitions. If this were a production system, you prob -\\nably would select separate partitions for /home , /var, and /tmp, but consider -\\ning that we will be using this as a learning system in a virtual environment, \\nit is safe for you to simply select All files in one partition .\\nNow you be will be asked whether to write your changes to disk. Select \\nFinish partitioning and write changes to disk . Kali will prompt you once \\nmore to see if you want to write the changes to disk; select Yes and click \\nContinue  (see Figure 13).\\nFigure 13: Writing changes to diskxxxiv   IntroductionKali will now begin to install the operating system. This could take a \\nwhile, so be patient. Now is the time to take your bathroom break and get \\nyour favorite beverage.\\nOnce the installation is complete, you will be prompted as to whether \\nyou want to use a network mirror. This really is not necessary, so click No.\\nThen Kali will prompt you as to whether you want to install GRUB \\n(Grand Unified Bootloader), shown in Figure 14. A bootloader  enables you \\nto select different operating systems to boot into, which means when you \\nboot your virtual machine, you can boot into either Kali or another oper -\\nating system. Select Yes and click Continue .\\nFigure 14: Installing GRUB\\nOn the next screen, you will be prompted as to whether you want to \\ninstall the GRUB bootloader automatically or manually. For reasons as yet \\nunclear, if you choose the second option, Kali will tend to hang and display \\na blank screen after installation. Select Enter device manually , as shown in \\nFigure 15.Introduction   xxxv\\nFigure 15: Entering your device manually\\nOn the following screen, select the drive where the GRUB bootloader \\nshould be installed (it will likely be something like  /dev/sda ). Click through to \\nthe next screen, which should tell you that the installation is complete.\\nCongratulations! You’ve installed Kali. Click Continue . Kali will \\nattempt to reboot, and you will see a number of lines of code go across \\na blank, black screen before you are eventually greeted with Kali 2018’s \\nlogin screen, as shown in Figure 16.\\nFigure 16: The Kali login screenxxxvi   IntroductionLog in as root, and you will be asked for your password. Enter whatever \\npassword you selected for your root user.\\nAfter logging in as root, you will be greeted with the Kali Linux desktop, \\nas in Figure 17.\\nFigure 17: The Kali home screen\\nYou are now ready to begin your journey into the exciting field of \\nhacking! Welcome!1\\nGETTING STARTED WITH  \\nTHE BASICS\\nBy our very nature, hackers are doers. We \\nwant to touch and play with things. We \\nalso want to create and, sometimes, break \\nthings. Few of us want to read long tomes of \\ninformation technology theory before we can do what \\nwe love most: hacking. With that in mind, this chapter \\nis designed to give you some fundamental skills to get \\nyou up and running in Kali . . . now!\\nIn this chapter, we won’t go into any one concept in great detail—we’ll \\ncover just enough to let you play and explore in the operating system of \\n hackers: Linux. We will save more in-depth discussions for later chapters.\\nIntroductory Terms and Concepts\\nBefore we begin our journey through the wonderful world of Linux Basics \\nfor Hackers , I want to introduce a few terms that should clarify some con -\\ncepts discussed later in this chapter.2   Chapter 1Binaries  This term refers to files that can be executed, similar to \\n executables in Windows. Binaries generally reside in the /usr/bin  or  \\nusr/sbin  directory and include utilities such as ps, cat, ls, and ifconfig  \\n(we’ll touch on all of four of these in this chapter) as well as applica -\\ntions such as the wireless hacking tool aircrack-ng and the intrusion \\ndetection system (IDS) Snort.\\nCase sensitivity  Unlike Windows, the Linux filesystem is case sensi -\\ntive. This means that Desktop  is different from desktop , which is different \\nfrom DeskTop . Each of these would represent a different file or directory \\nname. Many people coming from a Windows environment can find this \\nfrustrating. If you get the error message “file or directory not found” \\nand you are sure the file or directory exists, you probably need to check \\nyour case.\\nDirectory  This is the same as a folder in Windows. A directory pro -\\nvides a way of organizing files, usually in a hierarchical manner.\\nHome  Each user has their own /home  directory, and this is generally \\nwhere files you create will be saved by default.\\nKali Kali Linux is a distribution of Linux specifically designed for \\npenetration testing. It has hundreds of tools preinstalled, saving you \\nthe hours it would take to download and install them yourself. I will be \\nusing the latest version of Kali at the time of this writing: Kali 2018.2, \\nfirst released in April 2018.\\nroot Like nearly every operating system, Linux has an administrator \\nor superuser account, designed for use by a trusted person who can do \\nnearly anything on the system. This would include such things as recon -\\nfiguring the system, adding users, and changing passwords. In Linux, \\nthat account is called root. As a hacker or pentester, you will often use \\nthe root account to give yourself control over the system. In fact, many \\nhacker tools require that you use the root account.\\nScript  This is a series of commands run in an interpretive environ -\\nment that converts each line to source code. Many hacking tools are \\nsimply scripts. Scripts can be run with the bash interpreter or any of \\nthe other scripting language interpreters, such as Python, Perl, or Ruby. \\nPython is currently the most popular interpreter among hackers.\\nShell  This is an environment and interpreter for running commands \\nin Linux. The most widely used shell is bash, which stands for Bourne-\\nagain shell , but other popular shells include the C shell and Z shell. I \\nwill be using the bash shell exclusively in this book.\\nTerminal  This is a command line interface (CLI).\\nWith those basics behind us, we will attempt to methodically develop \\nthe essential Linux skills you’ll need to become a hacker or penetration tes -\\nter. In this first chapter, I’ll walk you through getting started with Kali Linux.Getting Started with the Basics    3A Tour of Kali\\nOnce you start Kali, you’ll be greeted with a login screen, as shown in \\nFigure 1-1. Log in using the root account username root and the default \\npassword toor (if you changed the password earlier, use your new password \\nhere).\\nFigure 1-1: Logging into Kali using the root account\\nYou should now have access to your Kali desktop (see Figure 1-2). We’ll \\nquickly look at two of the most basic aspects of the desktop: the terminal \\ninterface and file structure.\\nFigure 1-2: The Kali desktop4   Chapter 1The Terminal\\nThe first step in using Kali is to open the terminal , which is the command \\nline interface we’ll use in this book. In Kali Linux, you’ll find the icon \\nfor the terminal along the left of the desktop. Click this icon to open the \\nterminal. Your new terminal should look like the one shown in Figure 1-3.\\nFigure 1-3: The Kali terminal\\nThis terminal opens the command line environment, known as the shell, \\nwhich enables you to run commands on the underlying operating systems \\nand write scripts. Although Linux has many different shell environments, \\nthe most popular is the bash shell, which is also the default shell in Kali and \\nmany other Linux distributions.\\nTo change your password, you can use the command passwd . \\nThe Linux Filesystem\\nThe Linux filesystem structure is somewhat different from that of Windows. \\nLinux doesn’t have a physical drive (such as the C: drive) at the base of the \\nfile system but uses a logical filesystem instead. At the very top of the file -\\nsystem structure is /, which is often referred to as the root of the filesystem, \\nas if it were an upside-down tree (see Figure 1-4). Keep in mind that this is \\ndifferent from the root user. These terms may seem confusing at first, but \\nthey will become easier to differentiate once you get used to Linux.Getting Started with the Basics    5/\\n/root\\nSuperuser’s\\nhome\\ndirectory/boot\\nKernel\\nimage/home\\nUser\\ndirectories\\n/etc\\nSystem \\nconfiguration\\nfiles/mnt\\nGeneral-\\npurpose\\nmount point/proc\\nView of \\ninternal \\nkernel data/dev\\nSpecial\\ndevice files\\n/sys\\nKernel’s \\nview of the \\nhardware/bin\\nBinaries/sbin\\nBinaries\\n/lib\\nLibraries/usr\\n/bin\\nMore\\nbinaries/sbin\\nMore\\nbinaries\\n/lib\\nMore\\nlibraries\\nFigure 1-4: The Linux filesystem\\nThe root ( /) of the filesystem is at the top of the tree, and the following \\nare the most important subdirectories to know:\\n/root  The home directory of the all-powerful root user\\n/etc Generally contains the Linux configuration files—files that con -\\ntrol when and how programs start up\\n/home  The user’s home directory\\n/mnt  Where other filesystems are attached or mounted to the \\nfilesystem\\n/media  Where CDs and USB devices are usually attached or mounted \\nto the filesystem\\n/bin Where application binaries  (the equivalent of executables in \\nMicrosoft Windows or applications in macOS) reside\\n/lib Where you’ll find libraries  (shared programs that are similar to \\nWindows  DLLs)\\nWe’ll spend more time with these key directories throughout this book. \\nUnderstanding these first-level directories is important to navigating through \\nthe filesystem from the command line.\\nIt’s also important to know before you start that you should not log in \\nas root when performing routine tasks, because anyone who hacks your \\nsystem (yes, hackers sometimes get hacked) when you’re logged in as root \\nwould immediately gain root privileges and thus “own” your system. Log in \\nas a regular user when starting regular applications, browsing the web, run -\\nning tools like Wireshark, and so on. For the practice you’ll do in this book, \\nstaying logged in as root should be fine.\\nBasic Commands in Linux\\nTo begin, let’s look at some basic commands that will help you get up and \\nrunning in Linux.6   Chapter 1Finding Yourself with pwd\\nUnlike when you’re working in a graphical user interface (GUI) environ -\\nment like Windows or macOS, the command line in Linux does not always \\nmake it apparent which directory you’re presently in. To navigate to a new \\ndirectory, you usually need to know where you are currently. The present \\nworking directory  (or print working directory ) command, pwd, returns your \\nlocation within the directory structure.\\nEnter pwd in your terminal to see where you are:\\nkali >pwd\\n/root\\nIn this case, Linux returned /root , telling me I’m in the root user’s \\ndirectory. And because you logged in as root when you started Linux, you \\nshould be in the root user’s directory, too, which is one level below the top \\nof the filesystem structure ( /).\\nIf you’re in another directory, pwd will return that directory name \\ninstead.\\nChecking Your Login with whoami\\nIn Linux, the one “all-powerful” superuser or system administrator is named \\nroot, and it has all the system privileges needed to add users, change pass -\\nwords, change privileges, and so on. Obviously, you don’t want just anyone \\nto have the ability to make such changes; you want someone who can be \\ntrusted and has proper knowledge of the operating system. As a hacker, \\nyou usually need to have all those privileges to run the programs and com -\\nmands you need (many hacker tools won’t work unless you have root privi -\\nleges), so you’ll want to log in as root.\\nIf you’ve forgotten whether you’re logged in as root or another user, you \\ncan use the whoami  command to see which user you’re logged in as:\\nkali >whoami\\nroot\\nIf I had been logged in as another user, such as my personal account, \\nwhoami  would have returned my username instead, as shown here:\\nkali >whoami\\nOTW\\nNavigating the Linux Filesystem\\nNavigating the filesystem from the terminal is an essential Linux skill. To \\nget anything done, you need to be able to move around to find applications, \\nfiles, and directories located in other directories. In a GUI-based system, \\nyou can visually see the directories, but when you’re using the command Getting Started with the Basics    7line interface, the structure is entirely text based, and navigating the file -\\nsystem means using some commands.\\nChanging Directories with cd\\nTo change directories from the terminal, use the change directory  command, \\ncd. For example, here’s how to change to the /etc directory used to store con -\\nfiguration files:\\nkali >cd /etc\\nkali:/etc >\\nThe prompt changes to root@kali:/etc , indicating that we’re in the /etc \\ndirectory. We can confirm this by entering pwd:\\nkali:/etc > pwd\\n/etc\\nTo move up one level in the file structure (toward the root of the file \\nstructure, or /), we use cd followed by double dots ( ..), as shown here:\\nkali:/etc > cd ..\\nkali >pwd\\n/\\nkali >\\nThis moves us up one level from /etc to the / root directory, but you can \\nmove up as many levels as you need. Just use the same number of double-\\ndot pairs as the number of levels you want to move:\\n•\\tYou would use  .. to move up one level.\\n•\\tYou would use ../..  to move up two levels.\\n•\\tYou would use ../../..  to move up three levels, and so on.\\nSo, for example, to move up two levels, enter cd followed by two sets of \\ndouble dots with a forward slash in between:\\nkali >cd ../..\\nYou can also move up to the root level in the file structure from any -\\nwhere by entering cd /, where / represents the root of the filesystem.\\nListing the Contents of a Directory with ls\\nTo see the contents of a directory (the files and subdirectories), we can use \\nthe ls (list) command. This is very similar to the dir command in Windows.\\nkali >ls\\nbin    initrd.img        media        run        var8   Chapter 1boot   initrd.img.old    mnt          sbin       vmlinuz\\ndev    lib               opt          srv        vmlinuz.old\\netc    lib64             proc         tmp\\nhome   lost+found        root         usr\\nThis command lists both the files and directories contained in the \\ndirectory. You can also use this command on any particular directory, not \\njust the one you are currently in, by listing the directory name after the \\ncommand; for example, ls /etc  shows what’s in the /etc directory.\\nTo get more information about the files and directories, such as their \\npermissions, owner, size, and when they were last modified, you can add \\nthe -l switch after ls (the l stands for long). This is often referred to as \\nlong listing . Let’s try it here:\\nkali >ls -l\\ntotal 84\\ndrw-r--r--    1    root     root    4096    Dec    5  11:15    bin\\ndrw-r--r--    2    root     root    4096    Dec    5  11:15    boot\\ndrw-r--r--    3    root     root    4096    Dec    9  13:10    dev\\ndrw-r--r--    18   root     root    4096    Dec    9  13:43    etc\\n--snip--\\ndrw-r--r--    1    root     root    4096    Dec    5  11:15    var\\nAs you can see, ls -l  provides us with significantly more information, \\nsuch as whether an object is a file or directory, the number of links, the \\nowner, the group, its size, when it was created or modified, and its name.\\nI typically add the -l switch whenever doing a listing in Linux, but to \\neach their own. We’ll talk more about ls -l  in Chapter 5.\\nSome files in Linux are hidden and won’t be revealed by a simple ls or \\nls -l  command. To show hidden files, add a lowercase –a switch, like so:\\nkali >ls -la\\nIf you aren’t seeing a file you expect to see, it’s worth trying ls with the \\na flag When using multiple flags, you can combine them into one, as we’ve \\ndone here with -la instead of -l -a .\\nGetting Help\\nNearly every command, application, or utility has a dedicated help file in \\nLinux that provides guidance for its use. For instance, if I needed help \\nusing the best wireless cracking tool, aircrack-ng, I could simply type the \\naircrack-ng  command followed by the --help  command:\\nkali >aircrack-ng --help\\nNote the double dash here. The convention in Linux is to use a double \\ndash (--) before word options, such as help, and a single dash ( -) before \\nsingle-letter options, such as –h.Getting Started with the Basics    9When you enter this command, you should see a short description of \\nthe tool and guidance on how to use it. In some cases, you can use either -h \\nor -? to get to the help file. For instance, if I needed help using the hacker’s \\nbest port-scanning tool, nmap, I would enter the following:\\nkali >nmap -h\\nUnfortunately, although many applications support all three options \\n(--help , -h, and -?), there’s no guarantee the application you’re using will. \\nSo if one option doesn’t work, try another.\\nReferencing Manual Pages with man\\nIn addition to the help switch, most commands and applications have a \\nmanual (man) page with more information, such as a description and syn -\\nopsis of the command or application. You can view a man page by simply \\ntyping man before the command, utility, or application. To see the man page \\nfor aircrack-ng, for example, you would enter the following:\\nkali >man aircrack-ng\\nNAME\\n        aircrack-ng - a 802.11 WEP / WPA-PSK key cracker\\nSYNOPSIS\\n        aircrack-ng [options] <.cap / .ivs file(s)>\\nDESCRIPTION\\n        aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK key cracking program.  \\n        It can recover the WEP key once enough encrypted packets have been  \\n        captured with airodump-ng. This part of the aircrack-ng suite deter-  \\n        mines the WEP key using two fundamental methods. The first method is  \\n        via the PTW approach (Pyshkin, Tews, Weinmann). The main advantage  \\n        of the PTW approach is that very few data packets are required to  \\n        crack the WEP key. The second method is the FMS/KoreK method. The  \\n        FMS/KoreK method incorporates various statistical attacks to dis-  \\n        cover the WEP key and uses these in combination with brute forcing.  \\n        Additionally, the program offers a dictionary method for determining  \\n        the WEP key. For cracking WPA/WPA2 pre-shared keys, a wordlist (file  \\n        or stdin) or an airolib-ng has to be used.\\nThis opens the manual for aircrack-ng, providing you with more \\ndetailed information than the help screen. You can scroll through this \\nmanual file using the enter  key, or you can page up and down using the \\npg dn and pg up keys, respectively; you can also use the arrow keys. To exit, \\nsimply enter q (for quit), and you’ll return to the command prompt.\\nFinding Stuff\\nUntil you become familiar with Linux, it can be frustrating to find your way \\naround, but knowledge of a few basic commands and techniques will go a \\nlong way toward making the command line much friendlier. The following \\ncommands help you locate things from the terminal.10   Chapter 1\\nSearching with locate\\nProbably the easiest command to use is locate . Followed by a keyword denot -\\ning what it is you want to find, this command will go through your entire \\nfilesystem and locate every occurrence of that word.\\nTo look for aircrack-ng, for example, enter the following:\\nkali >locate aircrack-ng\\n/usr/bin/aircrack-ng\\n/usr/share/applications/kali-aircrack-ng.desktop\\n/usr/share/desktop-directories/05-1-01-aircrack-ng.directory\\n--snip--\\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/aircrack-ng.md5sums\\nThe locate  command is not perfect, however. Sometimes the results of \\nlocate  can be overwhelming, giving you too much information. Also, locate  \\nuses a database that is usually only updated once a day, so if you just created \\na file a few minutes or a few hours ago, it might not appear in this list until \\nthe next day. It’s worth knowing the disadvantages of these basic commands \\nso you can better decide when best to use each one.\\nFinding Binaries with whereis\\nIf you’re looking for a binary file, you can use the whereis  command to \\nlocate it. This command returns not only the location of the binary but \\nalso its source and man page if they are available. Here’s an example:\\nkali >whereis aircrack-ng\\naircarck-ng: /usr/bin/aircarck-ng /usr/share/man/man1/aircarck-ng.1.gz\\nIn this case, whereis  returned just the aircrack-ng binaries and man page, \\nrather than every occurrence of the word aircrack-ng . Much more efficient \\nand illuminating, don’t you think?\\nFinding Binaries in the PATH Variable with which\\nThe which  command is even more specific: it only returns the location of \\nthe binaries in the PATH variable in Linux. We’ll look more closely at the \\nPATH variable in Chapter 7, but for now it’s sufficient to know that PATH holds \\nthe directories in which the operating system looks for the commands you \\nexecute at the command line. For example, when I enter aircrack-ng  on \\nthe command line, the operating system looks to the PATH variable to see \\nin which directories it should look for aircrack-ng:\\nkali >which aircrack-ng\\n/usr/bin/aircrack-ng\\nHere, which  was able to find a single binary file in the directories listed \\nin the PATH variable. At minimum, these directories usually include /usr/bin , \\nbut may include /usr/sbin  and maybe a few others.Getting Started with the Basics    11Performing More Powerful Searches with find\\nThe find command is the most powerful and flexible of the searching utili -\\nties. It is capable of beginning your search in any designated directory and \\nlooking for a number of different parameters, including, of course, the file -\\nname but also the date of creation or modification, the owner, the group, \\npermissions, and the size.\\nHere’s the basic syntax for find:\\nfind directory options expression\\nSo, if I wanted to search for a file with the name apache2  (an open source \\nweb server) starting in the root directory, I would enter the following:\\nkali >find /\\uf075 -type f\\uf076 -name apache2 w\\nFirst I state the directory in which to start the search, in this case / \\uf075. \\nThen I specify which type of file to search for, in this case f for an ordi -\\nnary file \\uf076. Last, I give the name of the file I’m searching for, in this case \\napache2  w.\\nMy results for this search are shown here:\\nkali >find  / -type f -name apache2\\n/usr/lib/apache2/mpm-itk/apache2\\n/usr/lib/apache2/mpm-event/apache2\\n/usr/lib/apache2/mpm-worker/apache2\\n/usr/lib/apache2/mpm-prefork/apache2\\n/etc/cron.daily/apache2\\n/etc/logrotate.d/apache2\\n/etc/init.d/apache2\\n/etc/default/apache2\\nThe find command started at the top of the filesystem ( /), went through \\nevery directory looking for apache2  in the filename, and then listed all \\ninstances found.\\nAs you might imagine, a search that looks in every directory can be \\nslow. One way to speed it up is to look only in the directory where you would \\nexpect to find the file(s) you need. In this case, we are looking for a con -\\nfiguration file, so we could start the search in the /etc directory, and Linux \\nwould only search as far as its subdirectories. Let’s try it:\\nkali >find /etc -type f -name apache2\\n/etc/init.d/apache2\\n/etc/logrotate.d/apache2\\n/etc/cron.daily/apache2\\n/etc/default/apache2\\nThis much quicker search only found occurrences of apache2  in the  \\n/etc directory and its subdirectories. It’s also important to note that unlike \\nsome other search commands, find displays only exact  name matches. If the 12   Chapter 1file apache2  has an extension, such as apache2.conf , the search will not find a \\nmatch. We can remedy this limitation by using wildcards , which enable us to \\nmatch multiple characters. Wildcards come in a few different forms: * . , ? \\nand [].\\nLet’s look in the /etc directory for all files that begin with apache2  and \\nhave any extension. For this, we could write a find command using the fol -\\nlowing wildcard:\\nkali >find /etc -type f -name apache2.\\\\*\\n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf\\nWhen we run this command, we find that there is one file in the /etc  \\ndirectory that fits the apache2.*  pattern. When we use a period followed \\nby the * wildcard, the terminal looks for any extension after the filename \\napache2 . This can be a very useful technique for finding files where you \\ndon’t know the file extension.\\nWhen I run this command, I find two files that start with apache2  in the \\n/etc directory, including the apache2.conf  file.\\nA QUICK LOOK AT WILDCARDS\\nLet’s say we’re doing a search on a directory that has the files cat, hat, what, \\nand bat. The ? wildcard is used to represent a single character, so a search \\nfor ?at would find hat, cat, and bat but not what, because at in this filename is \\npreceded by two letters. The [] wildcard is used to match the characters that \\nappear inside the square brackets. For example, a search for [c,b]at  would \\nmatch cat and bat but not hat or what. Among the most widely used wildcards \\nis the asterisk ( *), which matches any character(s) of any length, from none to \\nan unlimited number of characters. A search for *at, for example, would find \\ncat, hat, what, and bat.\\nFiltering with grep\\nVery often when using the command line, you’ll want to search for a par -\\nticular keyword. For this, you can use the grep command as a filter to search \\nfor keywords.\\nThe grep command is often used when output is piped from one com -\\nmand to another. I cover piping in Chapter 2, but for now, suffice it to say \\nthat Linux (and Windows for that matter) allows us to take the output  of one \\ncommand and send it as input  to another command. This is called piping , \\nand we use the | command to do it (the | key is usually above the enter  key \\non your keyboard).\\nThe ps command is used to display information about processes run -\\nning on the machine. We cover this in more detail in Chapter 6, but for this Getting Started with the Basics    13example, suppose I want to see all the processes running on my Linux sys -\\ntem. In this case, I can use the ps (processes) command followed by the aux \\nswitches to specify which process information to display, like so:\\nkali >ps aux\\nThis provides me with a listing of all the processes running in this \\n system—but what if I just want to find one process to see if it is running?\\nI can do this by piping the output from ps to grep and searching for a \\nkeyword. For instance, to find out whether the apache2 service is running, \\nI would enter the following.\\nkali >ps aux | grep apache2\\nroot  4851 0.2 0.7 37548  7668 ?  Ss  10:14  0:00   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start\\nroot  4906 0.0 0.4 37572  4228 ?  S   10:14  0:00   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start\\nroot  4910 0.0 0.4 37572  4228 ?  Ss  10:14  0:00   /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start\\n--snip--\\nThis command tells Linux to display all my services and then send \\nthat output to grep, which will look through the output for the keyword \\napache2  and then display only the relevant output, thus saving me consid -\\nerable time and my eyesight.\\nModifying Files and Directories\\nOnce you’ve found your files and directories, you’ll want to be able to per -\\nform actions on them. In this section, we look at how to create files and \\ndirectories, copy files, rename files, and delete files and directories.\\nCreating Files\\nThere are many ways to create files in Linux, but for now we’ll just look at \\ntwo simple methods. The first is cat, which is short for concatenate , meaning \\nto combine pieces together (not a reference to your favorite domesticated \\nfeline). The cat command is generally used for displaying the contents of a \\nfile, but it can also be used to create small files. For creating bigger files, it’s \\nbetter to enter the code in a text editor such as vim, emacs, leafpad, gedit, \\nor kate and then save it as a file.\\nConcatenation with cat\\nThe cat command followed by a filename will display the contents of that \\nfile, but to create a file, we follow the cat command with a redirect , denoted \\nwith the > symbol, and a name for the file we want to create. Here’s an \\nexample:\\nkali >cat > hackingskills\\nHacking is the most valuable skill set of the 21st century!14   Chapter 1When you press enter , Linux will go into interactive mode  and wait for \\nyou to start entering content for the file. This can be puzzling because \\nthe prompt disappears, but if you simply begin typing, whatever you enter \\nwill go into the file (in this case, hackingskills ). Here, I entered Hacking  \\nis the most valuable skill set of the 21st century! . To exit and return to \\nthe prompt, I press ctrl -D. Then, when I want to see what’s in the file \\nhackingskills , I enter the following:\\nkali >cat hackingskills\\nHacking is the most valuable skill set of the 21st century!\\nIf you don’t use the redirect symbol, Linux will spit back the contents of \\nyour file. \\nTo add, or append , more content to a file, you can use the cat command \\nwith a double redirect ( >>), followed by whatever you want to add to the end \\nof the file. Here’s an example:\\nkali >cat >> hackingskills\\nEveryone should learn hacking\\nLinux once again goes into interactive mode, waiting for content to \\nappend to the file. When I enter Everyone should learn hacking  and press \\nctrl -D, I am returned to the prompt. Now, when I display the contents of \\nthat file with cat, I can see that the file has been appended with Everyone  \\nshould learn hacking , as shown here:\\nkali >cat hackingskills\\nHacking is the most valuable skill set of the 21st century! Everyone should \\nlearn hacking\\nIf I want to overwrite  the file with new information, I can simply use the \\ncat command with a single redirect again, as follows:\\nkali >cat > hackingskills\\nEveryone in IT security without hacking skills is in the dark\\nkali >cat hackingskills\\nEveryone in IT security without hacking skills is in the dark\\nAs you can see here, Linux goes into interactive mode, and I enter the \\nnew text and then exit back to the prompt. When I once again use cat to see \\nthe content of the file, I see that my previous words have been over  written \\nwith the latest text.\\nFile Creation with touch\\nThe second command for file creation is touch . This command was origi -\\nnally developed so a user could simply touch  a file to change some of its \\ndetails, such as the date it was created or modified. However, if the file \\ndoesn’t already exist, this command creates that file by default.Getting Started with the Basics    15Let’s create newfile  with touch :\\nkali >touch newfile\\nNow when I then use ls –l  to see the long list of the directory, I see that \\na new file has been created named newfile . Note that its size is 0 because there \\nis no content in newfile .\\nCreating a Directory\\nThe command for creating a directory in Linux is mkdir , a contraction of \\nmake directory . To create a directory named newdirectory , enter the following \\ncommand:\\nkali >mkdir newdirectory\\nTo navigate to this newly created directory, simply enter this:\\nkali >cd newdirectory\\nCopying a File\\nTo copy files, we use the cp command. This creates a duplicate of the file in \\nthe new location and leaves the old one in place.\\nHere, we’ll create the file oldfile  in the root directory with touch  and \\ncopy it to /root/newdirectory , renaming it in the process and leaving the ori -\\nginal oldfile  in place:\\nkali >touch oldfile\\nkali >cp oldfile  /root/newdirectory/newfile\\nRenaming the file is optional and is done simply by adding the name \\nyou want to give it to the end of the directory path. If you don’t rename the \\nfile when you copy it, the file will retain the original name by default.\\nWhen we then navigate to newdirectory , we see that there is an exact \\ncopy of oldfile  called newfile :\\nkali >cd newdirectory\\nkali >ls\\nnewfile   oldfile\\nRenaming a File\\nUnfortunately, Linux doesn’t have a command intended solely for renaming \\na file, as Windows and some other operating systems do, but it does have the \\nmv (move) command.16   Chapter 1The mv command can be used to move a file or directory to a new loca -\\ntion or simply to give an existing file a new name. To rename newfile  to \\nnewfile2 , you would enter the following:\\nkali >mv newfile newfile2\\nkali >ls\\noldfile newfile2\\nNow when you list ( ls) that directory, you see newfile2  but not newfile , \\nbecause it has been renamed. You can do the same with directories.\\nRemoving a File\\nTo remove a file, you can simply use the rm command, like so:\\nkali >rm newfile2\\nIf you now do a long listing on the directory, you can confirm that the \\nfile has been removed.\\nRemoving a Directory\\nThe command for removing a directory is similar to the rm command for \\nremoving files but with dir (for directory) appended, like so:\\nkali >rmdir newdirectory\\nrmdir:failed to remove \\'newdirectory\\': Directory not empty\\nIt’s important to note that rmdir  will not remove a directory that is not \\nempty, but will give you a warning message that the “directory is not empty,” \\nas you can see in this example. You must first remove all the contents of the \\ndirectory before removing it. This is to stop you from accidentally deleting \\nobjects you didn’t intend to delete.\\nIf you do want to remove a directory and its content all in one go, you \\ncan use the -r switch after rm, like so:\\nkali >rm -r newdirectory\\nJust a word of caution, though: be wary of using the -r option with rm, \\nat least at first, because it’s very easy to remove valuable files and directories \\nby mistake. Using rm -r  in your home directory, for instance, would delete \\nevery file and directory there—probably not what you were intending.Getting Started with the Basics    17Go Play Now!\\nNow that you have some basic skills for navigating around the filesystem, \\nyou can play with your Linux system a bit before progressing. The best way \\nto become comfortable with using the terminal is to try out your newfound \\nskills right now. In subsequent chapters, we will explore farther and deeper \\ninto our hacker playground.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 2, try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. Use the ls command from the root ( /) directory to explore the directory \\nstructure of Linux. Move to each of the directories with the cd command \\nand run pwd to verify where you are in the directory structure.\\n2. Use the whoami  command to verify which user you are logged in as.\\n3. Use the locate  command to find wordlists that can be used for password \\ncracking.\\n4. Use the cat command to create a new file and then append to that file. \\nKeep in mind that > redirects input to a file and >> appends to a file.\\n5. Create a new directory called hackerdirectory  and create a new file in \\nthat directory named hackedfile . Now copy that file to your /root directory \\nand rename it secretfile .2\\nTEXT MANIPULATION\\nIn Linux, nearly everything you deal with \\ndirectly is a file, and most often these will \\nbe text files; for instance, all configuration \\nfiles in Linux are text files. So to reconfigure \\nan application, you simply open the configuration \\nfile, change the text, save the file, and then restart \\nthe application—your reconfiguration is complete.\\nWith so many text files, manipulating text becomes crucial in manag -\\ning Linux and Linux applications. In this chapter, you’ll use several com -\\nmands and techniques for manipulating text in Linux.\\nFor illustrative purposes, I’ll use files from the world’s best network \\nintrusion detection system (NIDS), Snort, which was first developed by \\nMarty Roesch and is now owned by Cisco. NIDSs are commonly used to \\ndetect intrusions by hackers, so if you want to be a successful hacker, you \\nmust be familiar with the ways NIDSs can deter attacks and the ways you \\ncan abuse them to avoid detection.20   Chapter 2NOTE  If the version of Kali Linux you’re using doesn’t come preinstalled with Snort, you \\ncan download the files from the Kali repository by entering apt-get install snort .\\nViewing Files\\nAs demonstrated in Chapter 1, the most basic text display command is \\nprobably cat, but it has its limitations. Use cat to display the Snort config \\nfile (snort.conf  ) found in /etc/snort  (see Listing 2-1).\\nkali >cat /etc/snort/snort.conf\\nListing 2-1: Displaying snort.conf  in the terminal window\\nYour screen should now display the entire snort.conf  file, which will \\nstream until it comes to the end of the file, and should look something like \\nthe following code. This isn’t the most convenient or practical way to view \\nand work with this file.\\n#-------------------------------------------------\\n#  VRT Rule Packages Snort.conf\\n#\\n#  For more information visit us at:\\n#   HYPERLINK “http://www.snort.org/” http://www.snort.org       Snort Website\\n--snip--\\n# event thresholding or suppressions commands...\\nkali >\\nIn the following two sections, I will show you the head and tail com -\\nmands, which are two methods for displaying just part of a file’s content \\nin order to more easily view the key content.\\nFinding the Head\\nIf you just want to view the beginning of a file, you can use the head com -\\nmand. By default, this command displays the first 10 lines of a file. The \\nfollowing command, for instance, shows you the first 10 lines of snort.conf :\\nkali >head /etc/snort/snort.conf\\n#-------------------------------------------------\\n#    VRT Rule Packages Snort.conf\\n#\\n#    For more information visit us at:\\n--snip--\\n#      Snort bugs:bugs@snort.org\\nIf you want to see more or fewer than the default 10 lines, enter the \\nquantity you want with the dash ( -) switch after the call to head and before \\nthe filename. For example, if you want to see the first 20 lines of the file, \\nyou would enter the command shown at the top of Listing 2-2.Text Manipulation    21kali >head -20 /etc/snort/snort.conf\\n#-------------------------------------------------\\n#    VRT Rule Packages Snort.conf\\n#\\n#    For more information visit us at:\\n--snip--\\n#      Options : --enable-gre --enable-mpls --enable-targetbased\\n--enable-ppm --enable-perfprofiling enable-zlib --enable-act\\nlive-response --enable-normalizer --enable-reload --enable-react\\nListing 2-2: Displaying the first 20 lines of snort.conf  in the terminal window\\nYou should see only the first 20 lines of snort.conf  displayed in your \\n terminal window.\\nFinding the Tail\\nThe tail command is similar to the head command, but it’s used to view the \\nlast lines of a file. Let’s use it on snort.conf :\\nkali >tail /etc/snort/snort.conf\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/smtp.rules\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/specific-threats.rules\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-activex.rules\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-client.rules\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-iis.rules\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-miscp.rules\\n#Event thresholding and suppression commands. See threshold.conf\\nNotice that this command displays some of the last include  lines of the \\nrules files, but not all of them, because similar to head, the default for tail \\nis to show 10 lines. You can display more lines by grabbing the last 20 lines \\nof snort.conf . As with the head command, you can tell tail how many lines \\nto display by entering a dash ( -) and then the number of lines between the \\ncommand and the filename, as shown in Listing 2-3.\\nkali >tail -20 /etc/snort/snort.conf\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/chat.rules\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/dos.rules\\n#include $SO_RULE_PATH/exploit.rules\\n--snip--\\n#Event thresholding or suppression commands. See theshold.conf\\nListing 2-3: Displaying the last 20 lines of snort.conf  in the terminal window\\nNow we can view nearly all the include  lines of the rules files on one \\nscreen.22   Chapter 2Numbering the Lines\\nSometimes—especially with very long files—we may want the file to display \\nline numbers. Since snort.conf   has more than 600 lines, line numbers would \\nbe useful here. This makes it easier to reference changes and come back to \\nthe same place within the file.\\nTo display a file with line numbers, we use the nl (number lines) com -\\nmand. Simply enter the command shown in Listing 2-4.\\nkali >nl /etc/snort/snort.conf\\n612 #################################################################\\n613 #dynamic library rules\\n614 #include $SO_RULE_PATH/bad-traffic.rules\\n615 #include $SO_RULE_PATH/chat.rules\\n--snip--\\n630 #include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-iis.rules\\n631 #include $SO_RULE_PATH/web-misc.rules\\n632 #Event thresholding or suppression commands.

Note that \\nthis command skips the numbering for the blank lines.\\nFiltering Text with grep\\nThe command grep is probably the most widely used text manipulation com -\\nmand. It lets you filter the content of a file for display. If, for instance, you \\nwant to see all lines that include the word output  in your snort.conf  file, you \\ncould use cat and ask it to display only those lines (see Listing 2-5).\\nkali >cat /etc/snort/snort.conf | grep output\\n# 6) Configure output plugins\\n# Step #6: Configure output plugins\\n# output unified2: filename merged.log, limit 128, nostamp, mpls_event_types, \\nvlan_event_types\\noutput unified2: filename merged.log, limit 128, nostamp, mpls_event_types, \\nvlan_event_types\\n# output alert_unified2: filename merged.log, limit 128, nostamp\\n# output log_unified2: filename merged.log, limit 128, nostamp\\n# output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT\\n# output log_tcpdump: tcpdump.log\\nListing 2-5: Displaying lines with instances of the keyword or phrase specified by grep\\nThis command will first view snort.conf  and then use a pipe ( |) to send \\nit to grep, which will take the file as input, look for lines with occurrences of \\nthe word output , and display only those lines. The grep command is a very \\npowerful and essential command for working in Linux, because it can save \\nyou hours of searching for every occurrence of a word or command in a file.Text Manipulation    23Hacker Challenge: Using grep, nl, tail, and head\\nLet’s say you want to display the five lines immediately before a line that \\nsays # Step #6: Configure output plugins  using at least four of the commands \\nyou just learned. How would you do it? (Hint: there are many more options \\nto these commands than those we’ve discussed. You can learn more com -\\nmands by using the built-in Linux command man. For example, man tail  will \\nshow the help file for the tail command.)\\nThere are many ways to solve this challenge; here, I show you which \\nlines to change to do it one way, and your job is to find another method.\\nStep 1\\nkali >nl /etc/snort/snort.conf | grep output\\n    34    # 6) Configure output plugins\\n   512    # Step #6: Configure output plugins\\n   518    # output unified2: filename merged.log, limit 128, nostamp,  \\nmpls_event_types, vlan_event_types\\n   520    # output unified2: filename snort.log, limit 128, nostamp,  \\nmpls_event_types, vlan_event_types\\n   521    # output alert_unified2: filename snort.alert, limit 128, nostamp\\n   522    # output log_unified2: filename snort.log, limit 128, nostamp\\n   525    # output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT\\n   528    # output log_tcpdump: tcpdump.log\\nNOTE  Your line numbers may differ slightly as the snort.conf  file gets updated.\\nWe can see that the line # Step #6: Configure output plugins  is line 512, \\nand we know we want the five lines preceding line 512 as well as line 512 \\nitself (that is, lines 507 to 512).\\nStep 2\\nkali >tail -n+507 /etc/snort/snort.conf | head -n 6\\nnested_ip inner, \\\\\\nwhitelist $WHITE_LIST_PATH/white_list.rules, \\\\\\nblacklist $BLACK_LIST_PATH/black_list.rules\\n###################################################\\n# Step #6: Configure output plugins\\nHere, we use tail to start at line 507 and then output into head, and we \\nreturn just the top six lines, giving us the five lines preceding the Step #6  \\nline, with that line included.\\nUsing sed to Find and Replace\\nThe sed command lets you search for occurrences of a word or a text \\npattern and then perform some action on it. The name of the command 24   Chapter 2is a contraction of stream editor . In its most basic form, sed operates like the \\nFind and Replace function in Windows.\\nSearch for the word mysql  in the snort.conf  file using grep, like so:\\nkali >cat /etc/snort/snort.conf | grep mysql\\ninclude $RULE_PATH/mysql.rules\\n#include $RULE_PATH/server-mysql.rules\\nYou should see that the grep command found two occurrences of mysql .\\nLet’s say you want sed to replace every occurrence of mysql  with MySQL  \\n(remember, most of Linux is case sensitive) and then save the new file \\nto snort2.conf . You could do this by entering the command shown in \\nListing  2-6.\\nkali >sed s/mysql/MySQL/g /etc/snort/snort.conf > snort2.conf\\nListing 2-6: Using sed to find and replace keywords or phrases\\nThe s command performs the substitution: you first give the term you \\nare searching for ( mysql  ) and then the term you want to replace it with \\n(MySQL ), separated by a slash ( /). The g flag tells Linux that you want \\nthe replacement performed globally. Then the result is saved to a new file \\nnamed snort2.conf .\\nNow, when you use grep with snort2.conf  to search for mysql , you’ll see \\nthat no instances were found, but when you search for MySQL , you’ll see \\ntwo occurrences.\\nkali >cat snort2.conf | grep MySQL\\ninclude $RULE_PATH/MySQL.rules\\n#include $RULE_PATH/server-MySQL.rules\\nIf you wanted to replace only the first occurrence of the term mysql , you \\nwould leave out the trailing g option.\\nkali >sed s/mysql/MySQL/ snort.conf > snort2.conf\\nYou can also use the sed command to find and replace any specific  occur -\\nrence of a word rather than all occurrences or just the first occurrence. For \\ninstance, if you want to replace only the second occurrence of the word \\nmysql , simply place the number of the occurrence (in this case, 2) at the \\nend of the command:\\nkali >sed s/mysql/MySQL/2 snort.conf > snort2.conf\\nThis command affects only the second occurrence of mysql .Text Manipulation    25Viewing Files with more and less\\nAlthough cat is a good utility for displaying files and creating small files, it \\ncertainly has its limitations when displaying large files. When you use cat \\nwith snort.conf , the file scrolls through every page until it comes to the end, \\nwhich is not very practical if you want to glean any information from it.\\nFor working with larger files, we have two other viewing utilities: more \\nand less.\\nControlling the Display with more\\nThe more command displays a page of a file at a time and lets you page down \\nthrough it using the enter  key. Open snort.conf  with the more command, as \\nshown in Listing 2-7.\\nkali >more /etc/snort/snort.conf\\n--snip--\\n#     Snort build options:\\n# Options: --enable-gre --enable-mpls --enable-targetbased\\n--enable-ppm --enable-perfprofiling enable-zlib --enable-active\\n-response --enable-normalizer --enable-reload --enable-react\\n--enable-flexresp3\\n#\\n--More--(2%)\\nListing 2-7: Using more to display terminal output one page at a time\\nNotice that more displays only the first page and then stops, and it tells us \\nin the lower-left corner how much of the file is shown (2 percent in this case).\\nTo see additional lines or pages, press enter . To exit more, enter q (for quit).\\nDisplaying and Filtering with less\\nThe less command is very similar to more, but with additional functionality  \\n—hence, the common Linux aficionado quip, “Less is more.” With less, you \\ncan not only scroll through a file at your leisure, but you can also filter it for \\nterms. As in Listing 2-8, open snort.conf  with less.\\nkali >less /etc/snort/snort.conf\\n--snip--\\n#     Snort build options:\\n# Options: --enable-gre --enable-mpls --enable-targetbased\\n--enable-ppm --enable-perfprofiling enable-zlib --enable-active\\n-response --enable-normalizer --enable-reload --enable-react\\n/etc/snort/snort.conf\\nListing 2-8: Using less to both display terminal output a page at a time and filter results26   Chapter 2Notice in the bottom left of the screen that less has highlighted the \\npath to the file. If you press the forward slash ( /) key, less will let you \\nsearch for terms in the file. For instance, when you first set up Snort, you \\nneed to determine how and where you want to send your intrusion alert \\noutput. To find that section of the configuration file, you could simply \\nsearch for output , like so:\\n#     Snort build options:\\n# Options: --enable-gre --enable-mpls --enable-targetbased\\n   --enable-ppm --enable-perfprofiling enable-zlib --enable-active\\n-response --enable-normalizer --enable-reload --enable-react\\n   /output\\nThis will immediately take you to the first occurrence of output  and \\nhighlight it. You can then look for the next occurrence of output  by typing \\nn (for next).\\n# Step #6: Configure output plugins\\n# For more information, see Snort Manual, Configuring Snort - Output Modules\\n#####################################################################\\n#unified2\\n# Recommended for most installs\\n# output unified2: filename merged.log, limit 128, nostamp, mpls_event_types, \\nvlan_event_types\\noutput unified2: filename snort.log, limit 128, nostamp, mpls_event_types, \\nvlan_event_types\\n# Additional configuration for specific types of installs\\n# output alert_unified2: filename snort.alert, limit 128, nostamp\\n# output log_unified2: filename snort.log, limit 128, nostamp\\n# syslog\\n# output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT\\n:\\nAs you can see, less took you to the next occurrence of the word output  \\nand highlighted all the search terms. In this case, it went directly to the out -\\nput section of Snort. How convenient!\\nSummary\\nLinux has numerous ways of manipulating text, and each way comes with \\nits own strengths and weaknesses. We’ve touched on a few of the most use -\\nful methods in this chapter, but I suggest you try each one out and develop \\nyour own feel and preferences. For example, I think grep is indispensable, \\nand I use less widely, but you might feel different.Text Manipulation    27EXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 3, try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. Navigate to /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists . This is a \\ndirectory of multiple wordlists that can be used to brute force passwords \\nin various password-protected devices using Metasploit, the most popular \\npentesting and hacking framework.\\n2. Use the cat command to view the contents of the file password.lst .\\n3. Use the more command to display the file password.lst .\\n4. Use the less command to view the file password.lst .\\n5. Now use the nl command to place line numbers on the passwords in \\npassword.lst . There should be around 88,396 passwords.\\n6. Use the tail command to see the last 20 passwords in password.lst .\\n7. Use the cat command to display password.lst  and pipe it to find all the \\npasswords that contain 123.3\\nANALYZING AND MANAGING  \\nNETWORKS\\nUnderstanding networking is crucial for \\nany aspiring hacker. In many situations, \\nyou’ll be hacking something over a network, \\nand a good hacker needs to know how to con -\\nnect to and interact with that network. For example, \\nyou may need to connect to a computer with your \\nInternet Protocol (IP) address hidden from view, or you may need to redi -\\nrect a target’s Domain Name System (DNS) queries to your system; these \\nkinds of tasks are relatively simple but require a little Linux network know-\\nhow. This chapter shows you some essential Linux tools for analyzing and \\nmanaging networks during your network-hacking adventures.\\nAnalyzing Networks with ifconfig\\nThe ifconfig  command is one of the most basic tools for examining and \\ninteracting with active network interfaces. You can use it to query your \\nactive network connections by simply entering ifconfig  in the terminal. \\nTry it yourself, and you should see output similar to Listing 3-1.30   Chapter 3kali >ifconfig\\nueth0: flags=4163<UP, Broadcast, RUNNING, MULTICAST> mtu 1500\\nvinet addr:192.168.181.131 netmask 255.255.255.0\\n\\uf077Bcast:192.168.181.255\\n--snip--\\n\\uf078lo Linkencap:Local Loopback\\ninet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0\\n--snip--\\n\\uf079wlan0 Link encap:EthernetHWaddr 00:c0:ca:3f:ee:02\\nListing 3-1: Using ifconfig  to get network information\\nAs you can see, the command ifconfig  shows some useful informa -\\ntion about the active network interfaces on the system. At the top of the \\noutput is the name of the first detected interface, eth0 u, which is short for \\nEthernet0 (Linux starts counting at 0 rather than 1). This is the first wired \\nnetwork connection. If there were more wired Ethernet interfaces, they \\nwould show up in the output using the same format ( eth1, eth2, and so on).\\nThe type of network being used ( Ethernet ) is listed next, followed by \\nHWaddr  and an address; this is the globally unique address stamped on every \\npiece of network hardware—in this case, the network interface card (NIC), \\nusually referred to as the media access control (MAC) address.\\nThe second line contains information on the IP address currently \\nassigned to that network interface (in this case, 192.168.181.131 v); the \\nBcast  \\uf077, or broadcast address , which is the address used to send out informa -\\ntion to all IPs on the subnet; and finally the network mask  (netmask ), which is \\nused to determine what part of the IP address is connected to the local net -\\nwork. You’ll also find more technical info in this section of the output, but \\nit’s beyond the scope of this Linux networking basics chapter.\\nThe next section of the output shows another network connection \\ncalled lo \\uf078, which is short for loopback address  and is sometimes called \\nlocalhost . This is a special software address that connects you to your own \\nsystem. Software and services not running on your system can’t use it. You \\nwould use lo to test something on your system, such as your own web server. \\nThe localhost is generally represented with the IP address 127.0.0.1.\\nThe third connection is the interface wlan0  \\uf079. This appears only if you \\nhave a wireless interface or adapter, as I do here. Note that it also displays \\nthe MAC address of that device ( HWaddr ).\\nThis information from ifconfig  enables you to connect to and manipu -\\nlate your local area network (LAN) settings, an essential skill for hacking.\\nChecking Wireless Network Devices with iwconfig\\nIf you have an external USB, you can use the iwconfig  command to gather \\ncrucial information for wireless hacking such as the adapter’s IP address, its \\nMAC address, what mode it’s in, and more. The information you can glean \\nfrom this command is particularly important when you’re using wireless \\nhacking tools like aircrack-ng.Analyzing and Managing Networks    31Using the terminal, let’s take a look at some wireless devices with iwconfig  \\n(see Listing 3-2).\\nkali >iwconfig\\nwlan0 IEEE 802.11bg ESSID:off/any\\nMode:Managed Access Point: Not Associated Tx-Power=20 dBm\\n--snip--\\nlo    no wireless extensions\\neth0  no wireless extensions\\nListing 3-2: Using iwconfig  to get information on wireless adapters\\nThe output here tells us that the only network interface with wireless \\nextensions is wlan0 , which is what we would expect. Neither lo nor eth0 has \\nany wireless extensions.\\nFor wlan0 , we learn what 802.11 IEEE wireless standards our device is \\ncapable of: b and g, two early wireless communication standards. Most wire -\\nless devices now include n as well ( n is the latest standard).\\nWe also learn from iwconfig  the mode of the wireless extension (in this \\ncase, Mode:Managed , in contrast to monitor or promiscuous mode). We’ll need \\npromiscuous mode for cracking wireless passwords.\\nNext, we can see that the wireless adapter is not connected ( Not Associated ) \\nto an access point (AP) and that its power is 20 dBm, which represents the \\nstrength of signal. We’ll spend more time with this information in Chapter 14.\\nChanging Your Network Information\\nBeing able to change your IP address and other network information is a \\nuseful skill because it will help you access other networks while appearing \\nas a trusted device on those networks. For example, in a denial-of-service \\n(DoS) attack, you can spoof your IP so that that the attack appears to come \\nfrom another source, thus helping you evade IP capture during forensic \\nanalysis. This is a relatively simple task in Linux, and it’s done with the \\nifconfig  command.\\nChanging Your IP Address\\nTo change your IP address, enter ifconfig  followed by the interface you want \\nto reassign and the new IP address you want assigned to that interface. For \\nexample, to assign the IP address 192.168.181.115 to interface eth0, you would \\nenter the following:\\nkali >ifconfig eth0 192.168.181.115\\nkali >\\nWhen you do this correctly, Linux will simply return the command \\nprompt and say nothing. This is a good thing! 32   Chapter 3Then, when you again check your network connections with ifconfig , \\nyou should see that your IP address has changed to the new IP address you \\njust assigned.\\nChanging Your Network Mask and Broadcast Address\\nYou can also change your network mask (netmask) and broadcast address \\nwith the ifconfig  command. For instance, if you want to assign that same \\neth0 interface with a netmask of 255.255.0.0 and a broadcast address of \\n192.168.1.255, you would enter the following:\\nkali >ifconfig eth0 192.168.181.115 netmask 255.255.0.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255\\nkali >\\nOnce again, if you’ve done everything correctly, Linux responds with a \\nnew command prompt. Now enter ifconfig  again to verify that each of the \\nparameters has been changed accordingly.\\nSpoofing Your MAC Address\\nYou can also use ifconfig  to change your MAC address (or HWaddr ). The MAC \\naddress is globally unique and is often used as a security measure to keep \\nhackers out of networks—or to trace them. Changing your MAC address \\nto spoof a different MAC address is almost trivial and neutralizes those \\nsecurity measures. Thus, it’s a very useful technique for bypassing network \\naccess controls.\\nTo spoof your MAC address, simply use the ifconfig  command’s down \\noption to take down the interface ( eth0 in this case). Then enter the ifconfig  \\ncommand followed by the interface name ( hw for hardware, ether  for Ethernet) \\nand the new spoofed MAC address. Finally, bring the interface back up with \\nthe up option for the change to take place. Here’s an example:\\nkali >ifconfig eth0 down\\nkali >ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55\\nkali >ifconfig eth0 up\\nNow, when you check your settings with ifconfig , you should see that \\nHWaddr  has changed to your new spoofed IP address!\\nAssigning New IP Addresses from the DHCP Server\\nLinux has a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server that \\nruns a daemon —a process that runs in the background—called dhcpd , or the \\ndhcp daemon . The DHCP server assigns IP addresses to all the systems on the \\nsubnet and keeps log files of which IP address is allocated to which machine \\nat any one time. This makes it a great resource for forensic analysts to trace \\nhackers with after an attack. For that reason, it’s useful to understand how \\nthe DHCP server works.\\nUsually, to connect to the internet from a LAN, you must have a DHCP-\\nassigned IP. Therefore, after setting a static IP address, you must return and Analyzing and Managing Networks    33get a new DHCP-assigned IP address. To do this, you can always reboot your \\nsystem, but I’ll show you how to retrieve a new DHCP without having to shut \\nyour system down and restart it.\\nTo request an IP address from DHCP, simply call the DHCP server \\nwith the command dhclient  followed by the interface you want the address \\nassigned to. Different Linux distributions use different DHCP clients, but \\nKali is built on Debian, which uses dhclient . Therefore, you can assign a \\nnew address like this:\\nkali >dhclient eth0\\nThe dhclient  command sends a DHCPDISCOVER  request from the network \\ninterface specified (here, eth0). It then receives an offer ( DHCPOFFER ) from the \\nDHCP server (192.168.181.131 in this case) and confirms the IP assignment \\nto the DHCP server with a dhcp request. \\nkali >ifconfig\\neth0Linkencap:EthernetHWaddr 00:0c:29:ba:82:0f\\ninet addr:192.168.181.131 Bcast:192.168.181.131 Mask:255.255.255.0\\nDepending on the configuration of the DHCP server, the IP address \\nassigned in each case might be different.\\nNow when you enter ifconfig , you should see that the DHCP server has \\nassigned a new IP address, a new broadcast address, and new netmask to \\nyour network interface eth0.\\nManipulating the Domain Name System\\nHackers can find a treasure trove of information on a target in its Domain \\nName System (DNS). DNS is a critical component of the internet, and \\nalthough it’s designed to translate domain names to IP addresses, a hacker \\ncan use it to garner information on the target.\\nExamining DNS with dig\\nDNS is the service that translates a domain name like hackers-arise.com to \\nthe appropriate IP address; that way, your system knows how to get to it. \\nWithout DNS, we would all have to remember thousands of IP addresses \\nfor our favorite websites—no small task even for a savant.\\nOne of the most useful commands for the aspiring hacker is dig, which \\noffers a way to gather DNS information about a target domain. The stored \\nDNS information can be a key piece of early reconnaissance to obtain before \\nattacking. This information could include the IP address of the target’s \\nname  server (the server that translates the target’s name to an IP address), \\nthe target’s email server, and potentially any subdomains and IP addresses.\\nFor instance, enter dig hackers-arise.com  and add the ns option (short \\nfor nameserver ). The nameserver for hackers-arise.com  is displayed in the \\nANSWER SECTION  of Listing 3-3.34   Chapter 3kali >dig hackers-arise.com ns\\n--snip--\\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\\n;hackers-arise.com.

This \\nsection may look slightly different on your system or may not show at all.\\nYou can also use the dig command to get information on email \\n servers connected to a domain by adding the mx option ( mx is short for \\nmail exchange server ).

In some cases, Linux users will refer to DNS as BIND, but \\ndon’t be confused: DNS and BIND both map individual domain names to \\nIP addresses.\\nChanging Your DNS Server\\nIn some cases, you may want to use another DNS server. To do so, you’ll edit \\na plaintext file named /etc/resolv.conf  on the system. Open that file in a text \\neditor—I’m using Leafpad. Then, on your command line, enter the precise \\nname of your editor followed by the location of the file and the filename. \\nFor example,\\nkali >leafpad /etc/resolv.confAnalyzing and Managing Networks    35will open the resolv.conf  file in the /etc directory in my specified graphical \\ntext editor, Leafpad. The file should look something like Figure 3-1.\\nFigure 3-1: A typical resolv.conf  file in a text editor\\nAs you can see on line 3, my nameserver is set to a local DNS server at \\n192.168.181.2. That works fine, but if I want to replace that DNS server with, \\nsay, Google’s public DNS server at 8.8.8.8, I could place the following line in \\nthe /etc/resolv.conf file to specify the nameserver:\\nnameserver  8.8.8.8\\nThen I would just need to save the file. However, you can also achieve the \\nsame result exclusively from the command line by entering the following:\\nkali >echo \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\"> /etc/resolv.conf\\nThis command echoes the string nameserver 8.8.8.8  and redirects it ( >) \\nto the file /etc/resolv.conf , replacing the current content. Your /etc/resolv.conf  \\nfile should now look like Figure 3-2.\\nFigure 3-2: Changing the resolv.conf  file to specify Google’s DNS server\\nIf you open the /etc/resolv.conf file now, you should see that it points the \\nDNS requests to Google’s DNS server rather than your local DNS server. \\nYour system will now go out to the Google public DNS server to resolve \\ndomain names to IP addresses. This can mean domain names take a little \\nlonger to resolve (probably milliseconds). Therefore, to maintain speed but \\nkeep the option of using a public server, you might want to retain the local \\nDNS server in the resolv.conf  file and follow it with a public DNS server. The \\noperating system queries each DNS server listed in the order it appears in \\n/etc/resolv.conf , so the system will only refer to the public DNS server if the \\ndomain name can’t be found in the local DNS server.\\nNOTE  If you’re using a DHCP address and the DHCP server provides a DNS setting, the \\nDHCP server will replace the contents of the file when it renews the DHCP address.36   Chapter 3Mapping Your Own IP Addresses\\nA special file on your system called the hosts file also performs domain name–\\nIP address translation. The hosts file is located at /etc/hosts , and kind of as with \\nDNS, you can use it to specify your own IP address–domain name mapping. \\nIn other words, you can determine which IP address your browser goes to \\nwhen you enter www.microsoft.com  (or any other domain) into the browser, \\nrather than let the DNS server decide. As a hacker, this can be useful for \\nhijacking a TCP connection on your local area network to direct traffic to a \\nmalicious web server with a tool such as dnsspoof .\\nFrom the command line, type in the following command (you can sub -\\nstitute your preferred text editor for leafpad ):\\nkali >leafpad /etc/hosts\\nYou should now see your hosts file, which will look something like \\nFigure 3-3.\\nFigure 3-3: A default Kali Linux hosts file\\nBy default, the hosts file contains only a mapping for your localhost, at \\n127.0.0.1, and your system’s hostname (in this case, Kali, at 127.0.1.1). But you \\ncan add any IP address mapped to any domain you’d like. As an example of \\nhow this might be used, you could map www.bankofamerica.com  to your local \\nwebsite, at 192.168.181.131.\\n127.0.0.1       localhost\\n127.0.1.1       kali\\n192.168.181.131 bankofamerica.com\\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\\n::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\\nMake certain you press tab between the IP address and the domain \\nkey—not the spacebar.\\nAs you get more involved in your hacking endeavors and learn about \\ntools like dnsspoof  and Ettercap, you’ll be able to use the hosts file to direct \\nany traffic on your LAN that visits www.bankofamerica.com  to your web server \\nat 192.168.181.131.\\nPretty easy, right?Analyzing and Managing Networks    37Summary\\nAny hacker needs some basic Linux networking skills to connect, analyze, \\nand manage networks. As you progress, these skills will become more and \\nmore useful for doing reconnaissance, spoofing, and connecting to target \\nsystems.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 4, try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. Find information on your active network interfaces.\\n2. Change the IP address on eth0 to 192.168.1.1.\\n3. Change your hardware address on eth0.\\n4. Check whether you have any available wireless interfaces active.\\n5. Reset your IP address to a DHCP-assigned address.\\n6. Find the nameserver and email server of your favorite website.\\n7. Add Google’s DNS server to your /etc/resolv.conf  file so your system \\nrefers to that server when it can’t resolve a domain name query with \\nyour local DNS server.4\\nADDING AND REMOVING  \\nSOFTWARE\\nOne of the most fundamental tasks in \\nLinux—or any operating system—is add -\\ning and removing software. You’ll often \\nneed to install software that didn’t come with \\nyour distribution or remove unwanted software so it \\ndoesn’t take up hard drive space.\\nSome software requires other software to run, and you’ll sometimes \\nfind that you can download everything you need at once in a software package , \\nwhich is a group of files—typically libraries and other dependencies—that \\nyou need for a piece of software to run successfully. When you install a \\npackage, all the files within it are installed together, along with a script \\nto make loading the software simpler.\\nIn this chapter, we examine three key methods for adding new soft -\\nware: apt package manager, GUI-based installation managers, and git.40   Chapter 4Using apt to Handle Software\\nIn Debian-based Linux distributions, which include Kali and Ubuntu, the \\ndefault software manager is the Advanced Packaging Tool, or apt, whose \\nprimary command is apt-get . In its simplest and most common form, you \\ncan use apt-get  to download and install new software packages, but you can \\nalso update and upgrade software with it.\\nNOTE  Many Linux users prefer to use the apt command over apt-get . They are in many ways \\nsimilar, but apt-get  has more functionality and I think it’s worth learning early on.\\nSearching for a Package\\nBefore downloading a software package, you can check whether the pack -\\nage you need is available from your repository , which is a place where your \\noperating system stores information. The apt tool has a search function that \\ncan check whether the package is available. The syntax is straightforward:\\napt-cache search keyword\\nNote that we use the apt-cache  command to search the apt cache, or the \\nplace it stores the package names. So if you were searching for the intrusion \\ndetection system Snort, for example, you would enter the command shown \\nin Listing 4-1.\\nkali >apt-cache search snort\\nfwsnort - Snort-to-iptables rule translator\\nippl - IP protocols logger\\n--snip--\\nsnort - flexible Network Intrusion Detection System\\nsnort-common - flexible Network Intrusion Detection System - common files\\n--snip--\\nListing 4-1: Searching the system with apt-cache  for Snort\\nAs you can see, numerous files have the keyword snort  in them, but near \\nthe middle of the output we see snort – flexible Network Intrusion Detection  \\nSystem . That’s what we are looking for!\\nAdding Software\\nNow that you know the snort package exists in your repository, you can use \\napt-get  to download the software.\\nTo install a piece of software from your operating system’s default \\nrepository in the terminal, use the apt-get  command, followed by the key -\\nword install  and then the name of the package you want to install. The \\nsyntax looks like this:\\napt-get install packagenameAdding and Removing Software    41Let’s try this out by installing Snort on your system. Enter apt-get  \\ninstall snort  as a command statement, as shown in Listing 4-2.\\nkali >apt-get install snort\\nReading package lists...

If everything looks \\ncorrect, go ahead and enter y when prompted, and your software installa -\\ntion will proceed.\\nRemoving Software\\nWhen removing software, use apt-get  with the remove  option, followed by the \\nname of the software to remove (see Listing 4-3).\\nkali >apt-get remove snort\\nReading package lists...

You can enter y to uninstall, but you \\nmight want to keep Snort since we’ll be using it again. The remove  command \\ndoesn’t remove the configuration files, which means you can reinstall the \\nsame package in the future without reconfiguring.\\nIf you do want to remove the configuration files at the same time as the \\npackage, you can use the purge  option, as shown in Listing 4-4.\\nkali >apt-get purge  snort\\nReading package lists...

To keep things small and \\nmodular, many Linux packages are broken into software units that many \\ndifferent programs might use. When you installed Snort, you installed sev -\\neral dependencies or libraries with it that Snort requires in order to run. \\nNow that you’re removing Snort, those other libraries or dependencies are \\nno longer required, so they can be removed by running apt autoremove .\\nkali > apt autoremove snort\\nReading Package lists...Done\\nBuilding dependency tree\\nReading state information ...done\\n--snip--\\nRemoving snort-common-libaries (2.9.7.0-5)...\\nRemoving libdaq2 (2.04-3+b1) …\\nRemoving oikmaster (2.0-4)\\n--snip--\\nUpdating Packages\\nSoftware repositories will be periodically updated with new software or new \\nversions of existing software. These updates don’t reach you automatically, \\nso you have to request them in order to apply these updates to your own sys -\\ntem. Updating  isn’t the same as upgrading : updating simply updates the list \\nof packages available for download from the repository, whereas upgrading \\nwill upgrade the package to the latest version in the repository.\\nYou can update your individual system by entering the apt-get  c ommand \\nfollowed by the keyword update . This will search through all the packages on \\nyour system and check whether updates are available. If so, the updates are \\ndownloaded (see Listing 4-5).\\nkali >apt-get update\\nGet:1 http://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/kali kali-rolling InRelease [30.5kb]\\nGet:2 http://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/kali kali-rolling/main amd64 Packages [14.9MB]\\nGet:3 http://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/kali kali-rolling non-free amd64 Packages [163kb]\\nGet:4 http://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/kali kali-rolling/contrib amd64 Packages [107 kB]\\nFetched 15.2 MB in 1min 4s (236 kB/s)\\nReading package lists...

This command \\nwill upgrade every package on your system that apt knows about, meaning \\nonly those stored in the repository (see Listing 4-6). Upgrading can be \\ntime-consuming, so you might not be able to use your system for a while.\\nkali >apt-get upgrade\\nReading package lists... Done\\nBuilding dependency tree...

Go ahead and enter Y \\nif you want to continue and have enough hard drive space for the upgrade.\\nAdding Repositories to Your sources.list File\\nThe servers that hold the software for particular distributions of Linux are \\nknown as repositories . Nearly every distribution has its own repositories of \\nsoftware—developed and configured for that distribution—that might not \\nwork well, or at all, with other distributions. Although these repositories \\noften contain the same or similar software, they aren’t identical, and they \\nsometimes have different versions of the same software or entirely different \\nsoftware.\\nYou will, of course, be using the Kali repository, which has a large \\namount of security and hacking software. But because Kali specializes in \\nsecurity and hacking, it doesn’t include some specialty software and tools \\nand even some run-of-the-mill software. It’s worth adding a backup reposi -\\ntory or two that your system can search through in case it doesn’t find it a \\nspecific software in the Kali repository. \\nThe repositories your system will search for software are stored in the \\nsources.list  file, and you can alter this file to define from which repositories \\nyou want to download software. I often add the Ubuntu repositories after 44   Chapter 4the Kali repositories in my sources.list  file; that way, when I request to down -\\nload a new software package, if it isn’t in the Kali repository, my system may \\nfind it in the Ubuntu repository. \\nYou can find the sources.list  file at /etc/apt/sources.list  and open it with any \\ntext editor. I’ll again be using Leafpad. To open the sources.list  file, enter the \\nfollowing into your terminal, replacing leafpad  with the name of your editor:\\nkali >leafpad /etc/apt/sources.list\\nAfter entering this command, you should see a window like the one in \\nFigure 4-1, with a list of Kali’s default repositories.\\nFigure 4-1: Kali’s default repositories in sources.list\\nMany Linux distributions divide repositories into separate categories. \\nFor instance, Debian breaks out its repository categories as follows:\\nmain  Contains supported open source software\\nuniverse  Contains community-maintained open source software\\nmultiverse  Contains software restricted by copyright or other legal \\nissues\\nrestricted  Contains proprietary device drivers\\nbackports  Contains packages from later releases\\nI don’t recommend using testing, experimental, or unstable reposito -\\nries in your sources.list  because they can download problematic software to \\nyour system. Software that isn’t fully tested might break your system.\\nWhen you ask to download a new software package, the system looks \\nthrough your repositories listed in sources.list  and selects the most recent \\nversion of the desired package. Check first that the repository is compatible \\nfor your system. Kali, like Ubuntu, is built on Debian, so these repositories \\nwork pretty well with each of these systems.\\nTo add a repository, just edit the sources.list  file by adding the name of \\nthe repository to the list and then save the file. Say, for example, you want \\nto install Oracle Java 8 on Kali. No apt package for Oracle Java 8 is available \\nas part of the default Kali sources, but a quick search online shows that the \\nfine folk at WebUpd8 have created one. If you add their repository to the Adding and Removing Software    45sources, you can then install Oracle Java 8 with the apt-get install oracle  \\n-java8-installer  command. At the time of writing, you would need to add \\nthe following repository locations to sources.list  in order to add the necessary \\nrepositories:\\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main\\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main\\nUsing a GUI-based Installer\\nNewer versions of Kali no longer include a GUI-based software installation \\ntool, but you can always install one with the apt-get  command. The two \\nmost common GUI-based installation tools are Synaptic and Gdebi. Let’s \\ninstall Synaptic and use it to install our Snort package:\\nkali >apt-get install synaptic\\nReading package lists... Done\\nBuilding dependency tree\\nReading state information... Done\\n--snip--\\nProcessing triggers for menu (2.1.47)...\\nkali >\\nOnce you have Synaptic installed, you can start it by entering synaptic  at \\nthe command line prompt or from the GUI by going to Settings4Synaptic \\nPackage Manager , which should open a window like the one in Figure 4-2.\\nFigure 4-2: The Synaptic Package Manager interface46   Chapter 4Now you can search for the package you’re looking for. Simply click \\nthe Search  tab to open a search window. Because you are looking for Snort \\nagain, enter snort  into the search window and click Search . Scroll down the \\nsearch results to find the package you’re looking for. Check the box next to \\nsnort  and then click the Apply  tab, as shown in Figure 4-3. Synaptic will now \\ndownload and install Snort from the repository along with any necessary \\ndependencies.\\nFigure 4-3: Downloading Snort from the Synaptic Package Manager\\nInstalling Software with git\\nSometimes the software you want isn’t available in any of the repositories—\\nespecially if it’s brand new—but it may be available on github ( https://www  \\n.github.com/ ), a site that allows developers to share their software with others \\nto download, use, and provide feedback. For instance, if you want bluediv -\\ning, a Bluetooth hacking and pentesting suite, and can’t find it in the Kali \\nrepository, you can search github for the software by entering bluediving  \\ninto the search bar. If it exists on github, you should see the repository for \\nit in the search results. \\nOnce you’ve found the software on github, you can install it from the \\nterminal by entering the git clone  command followed by its github URL. \\nFor instance, bluediving is located at https://www.github.com/balle/bluediving  \\n.git. To clone it into your system, enter the command shown in Listing 4-7.\\nkali >git clone https://www.github.com/balle/bluediving.git\\nCloning into \\'bluediving\\'...\\nremote: Counting objects: 131, Done.\\nremote: Total 131 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 131\\nReceiving objects: 100% (131/131), 900.81 KiB | 646.00 KiB/s, Done.Adding and Removing Software    47Resolving deltas: 100% (9/9), Done.\\nChecking connectivity...

You can check to see that they’ve been successfully down -\\nloaded by using the long listing command ls –l  on the target directory, \\nlike so:\\nkali >ls -l\\nIf you’ve successfully cloned bluediving to your system, you should see \\nsomething like the following output:\\ntotal 80\\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root  4096 Jan 10 22:19 bluediving\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Dec  5 11:17 Desktop\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Dec  5 11:17 Documents\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Dec  5 11:17 Downloads\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Dec  5 11:17 Music\\n--snip--\\nAs you can see, bluediving has been successfully cloned to the system, \\nand a new directory named bluediving  has been created for its files.\\nSummary\\nIn this chapter, you learned a few of the many ways to download and install \\nnew software on your Linux system. Software package managers (like apt), \\nGUI-based installers, and git clones are the most common and crucial \\nmethods for an aspiring hacker to know. You’ll soon find yourself becom -\\ning familiar with each of them.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 5, try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. Install a new software package from the Kali repository.\\n2. Remove that same software package.\\n3. Update your repository.\\n4. Upgrade your software packages.\\n5. Select a new piece of software from github and clone it to your system.5\\nCONTROLLING FILE AND  \\nDIRECTORY PERMISSIONS\\nNot every user of a single operating system \\nshould have the same level of access to files \\nand directories. Like any professional or \\nenterprise-level operating system, Linux has \\nmethods for securing file and directory access. This \\nsecurity system allows the system administrator—the \\nroot user—or the file owner to protect their files from \\nunwanted access or tampering by granting select users permissions  to read, \\nwrite, or execute files. For each file and directory, we can specify the per -\\nmission status for the file’s owner, for particular groups of users, and for \\nall other users. This is a necessity in a multiuser, enterprise-level operating \\nsystem. The alternative would be quite chaotic.\\nIn this chapter, I’ll show you how to check for and change permissions \\non files and directories for select users, how to set default file and directory \\npermissions, and how to set special permissions. Finally, you will see how a \\nhacker’s understanding of permissions might help them exploit a system.50   Chapter 5Different Types of Users\\nAs you know, in Linux, the root user is all-powerful. The root user can do \\nbasically anything  on the system. Other users on the system have more lim -\\nited capabilities and permissions and almost never have the access that the \\nroot user has.\\nThese other users are usually collected into groups  that generally share \\na similar function. In a commercial entity, these groups might be finance, \\nengineering, sales, and so on. In an IT environment, these groups might \\ninclude developers, network administrators, and database administrators. \\nThe idea is to put people with similar needs into a group that is granted \\nrelevant permissions; then each member of the group inherits the group \\npermissions. This is primarily for the ease of administering permissions \\nand, thus, security.\\nThe root user is part of the root group by default. Each new user on the \\nsystem must be added to a group in order to inherit the permissions of that \\ngroup.\\nGranting Permissions\\nEach and every file must be allocated a particular level of permission \\nfor the different identities using it. The three levels of permission are as \\nfollows:\\nr Permission to read. This grants permission only to open and view \\na file.\\nw Permission to write. This allows users to view and edit a file.\\nx Permission to execute. This allows users to execute a file (but not \\nnecessarily view or edit it).\\nIn this way, the root user can grant users a level of permission depend -\\ning on what they need the files for. When a file is created, typically the user \\nwho created it is the owner of the file, and the owning group is the user’s \\ncurrent group. The owner of the file can grant various access privileges to \\nit. Let’s look at how to change permissions to pass ownership to individual \\nusers and to groups.\\nGranting Ownership to an Individual User\\nTo move ownership of a file to a different user so that they have the ability \\nto control permissions, we can use the chown  (or change owner) command:\\nkali >chown ubob v/tmp/bobsfile\\nHere, we give the command, the name of the user we are giving owner -\\nship to, and then the location and name of the relevant file. This command \\ngrants the user account for Bob u ownership of bobsfile  v.Controlling File and Directory Permissions    51Granting Ownership to a Group\\nTo transfer ownership of a file from one group to another, we can use the \\nchgrp  (or change group) command.\\nHackers are often more likely to work alone than in groups, but it’s not \\nunheard of for several hackers or pentesters work together on a project, and \\nin that case, using groups is necessary. For instance, you might have a group \\nof pentesters and a group of security team members working on the same \\nproject. The pentesters in this example are the root group, meaning they \\nhave all permissions and access. The root group needs access to the hack -\\ning tools, whereas the security folk only need access to defensive tools such \\nas an intrusion detection system (IDS). Let’s say the root group downloads \\nand installs a program named newIDS; the root group will need to change \\nthe ownership to the security group so the security group can use it at will. \\nTo do so, the root group would simply enter the following command:\\nkali >chgrp usecurity vnewIDS\\nThis command passes the security  group u ownership of newIDS v.\\nNow you need to know how to check whether these allocations have \\nworked. You’ll do that by checking a file’s permissions.\\nChecking Permissions\\nWhen you want to find out what permissions are granted to what users for \\na file or directory, use the ls command with the –l (long) switch to display \\nthe contents of a directory in long format—this list will contain the permis -\\nsions. In Listing 5-1, I use the ls –l  command on the file /usr/share/hashcat  \\n(one of my favorite password-cracking tools) in order to see what we can \\nlearn about the files there.\\nkali >ls –l /usr/share/hashcat\\ntotal 32952\\nu v       w  x            y         z           {\\ndrwxr-xr-x  5  root  root    4096     Dec 5 10:47  charsets\\n-rw-r--r--  1  root  root    33685504 June 28 2018 hashcat.hcstat\\n-rw-r--r--  1  root  root    33685504 June 28 2018 hashcat.hctune\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2   root  root    4096     Dec 5 10:47  masks\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2   root  root    4096     Dec 5 10:47  OpenCL\\ndrwxr-xr-x 3   root  root    4096     Dec 5 10:47  rules\\nListing 5-1: Checking a file’s permissions with the long listing command\\nOn each line, we get information about:\\nu The file type (this is the first character listed)\\nv The permissions on the file for owner, groups, and users, respectively \\n(this is the rest of this section)\\nw The number of links (This topic is beyond the scope of the book.)52   Chapter 5x The owner of the file\\ny The size of the file in bytes\\nz When the file was created or last modified\\n{ The name of the file\\nFor now, let’s focus on the seemingly incomprehensible strings of letters \\nand dashes on the left edge of each line. They tell us whether an item is a \\nfile or directory and what permissions, if any, are on it.\\nThe first character tells you the file type, where d stands for a directory \\nand a dash ( –) indicates a file. These are the two most common file types.\\nThe next section defines the permissions on the file. There are three sets \\nof three characters, made of some combination of read ( r), write ( w), and \\nexecute ( x), in that order. The first set represents the permissions of the \\nowner; the second, those of the group; and the last, those of all other users.\\nRegardless of which set of three letters you’re looking at, for files, if \\nyou see an r first, that user or group of users has permission to open and \\nread that file or directory. A w as the middle letter means they can write to \\n(modify) the file, and an x at the end means they can execute (or run) the \\nfile or access the directory. If any r, w, or x is replaced with a dash ( -), then \\nthe respective permission hasn’t been given. Note that users can have per -\\nmission to execute only either binaries or scripts.\\nLet’s use the third line of output in Listing 5-1 as an example:\\n-rw-r--r-- 1   root  root    33685504 June 28 2018 hashcat.hcstat\\nThe file is called, as we know from the right end of the line, hashcat.hcstat . \\nAfter the initial – (which indicates it’s a file), the permissions rw- tell us that \\nthe owner has read and write permissions but not execute permission.\\nThe next set of permissions ( r--) represents those of the group and \\nshows that the group has read permission but not write or execute permis -\\nsions. And, finally, we see that the rest of the users also have only read per -\\nmission ( r--).\\nThese permissions aren’t set in stone. As a root user or file owner, you \\ncan change them. Next, we’ll do just that.\\nChanging Permissions\\nWe can use the Linux command chmod  (or change mode) to change the per -\\nmissions. Only a root user or the file’s owner can change permissions. \\nIn this section, we use chmod  to change permissions on hashcat.hcstat  \\nusing two different methods. First we use a numerical representation of \\n permissions, and then we use a symbolic representation.\\nChanging Permissions with Decimal Notation\\nWe can use a shortcut to refer to permissions by using a single number \\nto represent one rwx set of permissions. Like everything underlying the Controlling File and Directory Permissions    53operating system, permissions are represented in binary, so ON and OFF \\nswitches are represented by 1 and 0, respectively. You can think of the \\nrwx permissions as three ON/OFF switches, so when all permissions are \\ngranted, this equates to 111 in binary.\\nA binary set like this is then easily represented as one digit by convert -\\ning it into octal, an eight-digit number system that starts with 0 and ends \\nwith 7. An octal digit represents a set of three binary digits, meaning we \\ncan represent an entire rwx set with one digit. Table 5-1 contains all possible \\npermission combinations and their octal and binary representatives.\\nTable 5-1: Octal and Binary  \\nRepresentations of Permissions\\nBinary Octal rwx\\n000 0 ---\\n001 1 --x\\n010 2 -w-\\n011 3 -wx\\n100 4 r--\\n101 5 r-x\\n110 6 rw-\\n111 7 rwx\\nUsing this information, let’s go through some examples. First, if we \\nwant to set only the read permission, we could consult Table 5-1 and locate \\nthe value for read:\\nr w x\\n4 - -\\nNext, if we want to set the permission to wx, we could use the same \\nmethodology and look for what sets the w and what sets the x:\\nr w x\\n- 2 1\\nNotice in Table 5-1 that the octal representation for -wx is 3, which not \\nso coincidently happens to be the same value we get when we add the two \\nvalues for setting w and x individually: 2 + 1 = 3.\\nFinally, when all three permissions are on, it looks like this:\\nr w x\\n4 2 1\\nAnd 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Here, we see that in Linux, when all the permission \\nswitches are on, they are represented by the octal equivalent of 7. 54   Chapter 5So, if we wanted to represent all permissions for the owner, group, and \\nall users, we could write it as follows:\\n7 7 7\\nHere’s where the shortcut comes in. By passing chmod  three octal digits \\n(one for each rwx set), followed by a filename, we can change permissions on \\nthat file for each type of user. Enter the following into your command line:\\nkali >chmod 774 hashcat.hcstat\\nLooking at Table 5-1, we can see that this statement gives the owner all \\npermissions, the group all permissions, and everyone else (other) only the \\nread permission.\\nNow we can see whether those permissions have changed by running \\nls -l  on the directory and looking at the hashcat.hcstat  line. Navigate to the \\ndirectory and run that command now:\\nkali >ls -l\\ntotal 32952\\ndrwxr-xr-x 5     root  root        4096   Dec 5 10:47  charsets\\nu -rwxrwxr-- 1     root  root    33685504   June 28 2018 hashcat.hcstat\\n-rw-r--r-- 1     root  root    33685504   June 28 2018 hashcat.hctune\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2     root  root        4096   Dec 5 10:47  masks\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2     root  root        4096   Dec 5 10:47  OpenCL\\ndrwxr-xr-x 3     root  root        4096   Dec 5 10:47  rules\\nYou should see -rwxrwxr--  on the left side of the hashcat.hcstat  line u. \\nThis confirms that the chmod  call successfully changed permissions on the \\nfile to give both the owner and the group the ability to execute the file.\\nChanging Permissions with UGO\\nAlthough the numeric method is probably the most common method for \\nchanging permissions in Linux, some people find chmod ’s symbolic method \\nmore intuitive—both methods work equally well, so just find the one that \\nsuits you. The symbolic method is often referred to as the UGO  syntax, \\nwhich stands for user (or owner), group , and others .\\nUGO syntax is very simple. Enter the chmod  command and then the users \\nyou want to change permissions for, providing u for user, g for group, or o for \\nothers, followed by one of three operators:\\n- Removes a permission\\n+ Adds a permission\\n= Sets a permission\\nAfter the operator, include the permission you want to add or remove \\n(rwx) and, finally, the name of the file to apply it to.Controlling File and Directory Permissions    55So, if you want to remove the write permission from the user that the \\nfile hashcat.hcstat  belongs to, you could enter the following:\\nkali >chmod u-w hashcat.hcstat\\nThis command says to remove ( -) the write ( w) permission from hashcat  \\n.hcstat  for the user ( u).\\nNow when you check the permissions with ls –l  again, you should see \\nthat the hashcat.hcstat  file no longer has write permission for the user:\\nkali >ls -l\\ntotal 32952\\ndrwxr-xr-x 5     root  root        4096    Dec 5 10:47 charsets\\n-r-xr-xr-- 1     root  root    33685504   June 28 2018 hashcat.hcstat\\n-rw-r--r-- 1     root  root    33685504   June 28 2018 hashcat.hctune\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2     root  root        4096    Dec 5 10:47 masks\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2     root  root        4096    Dec 5 10:47 OpenCL\\ndrwxr-xr-x 3     root  root        4096    Dec 5 10:47 rules\\nYou can also change multiple permissions with just one command. If \\nyou want to give both the user and other users (not including the group) \\nexecute permission, you could enter the following:\\nkali >chmod u+x, o+x hashcat.hcstat\\nThis command tells Linux to add the execute permission for the user \\nas well as the execute permission for others for the hashcat.hcstat  file.\\nGiving Root Execute Permission on a New Tool\\nAs a hacker, you’ll often need to download new hacking tools, but Linux \\nautomatically assigns all files and directories default permissions of 666 and \\n777, respectively. This means that, by default, you won’t be able to execute a \\nfile immediately after downloading it. If you try, you’ll usually get a message \\nthat says something like “Permission denied.” For these cases, you’ll need to \\ngive yourself root and execute permissions using chmod  in order to execute \\nthe file.\\nFor example, say we download a new hacker tool called newhackertool  \\nand place it into the root user’s directory ( /).\\nkali >ls -l\\ntotal 80\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec 5  11.17  Desktop\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec 5  11.17  Documents\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec 5  11.17  Downloads\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec 5  11.17  Music\\n-rw-r--r--  1  root  root  1072  Dec 5  11.17  newhackertool u\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec 5  11.17  Pictures56   Chapter 5drwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec 5  11.17  Public\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec 5  11.17  Templates\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec 5  11.17  Videos\\nWe can see newhackertool  at u, along with the rest of the contents of the \\nroot directory. We can see that our newhackertool  doesn’t have execute per -\\nmission for anyone. This makes it impossible to use. It might seem strange \\nthat by default, Linux won’t let you execute a file you downloaded, but over -\\nall this setting makes your system more secure.\\nWe can give ourselves permission to execute newhackertool  by entering \\nthe following:\\nkali >chmod 766 newhackertool\\nNow, when we perform a long listing on the directory, we can see that \\nour newhackertool  has execute permission for the owner:\\nkali >chmod 766 newhackertool\\nkali >ls -l\\ntotal 80\\n--snip--\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec  5  11.17  Music\\n-rwxrw-rw-  1  root  root  1072  Dec  5  11.17  newhackertool\\ndrwxr-xr-x  7  root  root  4096  Dec  5  11.17  Pictures\\n--snip--\\nAs you now understand, this grants us (as the owner) all permissions, \\nincluding execute, and grants the group and everyone else only read and \\nwrite permissions (4 + 2 = 6).\\nSetting More Secure Default Permissions with Masks\\nAs you have seen, Linux automatically assigns base permissions—usually \\n666 for files and 777 for directories. You can change the default permissions \\nallocated to files and directories created by each user with the umask  (or user \\nfile-creation mask) method. The umask  method represents the permissions \\nyou want to remove  from the base permissions on a file or directory to make \\nthem more secure.\\nThe umask  is a three-digit octal number corresponding to the three \\npermissions digits, but the umask  number is subtracted  from the permissions \\nnumber to give the new permissions status. This means that when a new file \\nor directory is created, its permissions are set to the default value minus the \\nvalue in umask , as shown in Figure 5-1.Controlling File and Directory Permissions    57Resulting permissionsumask6 6 6\\n0 2 2\\n6 4 4New files\\n−7 7 7\\n0 2 2\\n7 5 5New directories\\n−Linux base permissions\\nFigure 5-1: How a umask  value of 022 affects the permissions  \\non new files and directories\\nFor example, if the umask  is set to 022, a new file with the original default \\npermissions of 666 will now have the permissions 644, meaning the owner \\nhas both read and write permissions, and the group and all other users \\nhave only read permission.\\nIn Kali, as with most Debian systems, the umask  is preconfigured to 022, \\nmeaning the Kali default is 644 for files and 755 for directories. \\nThe umask  value is not universal to all users on the system. Each user \\ncan set a personal default umask  value for the files and directories in their \\npersonal .profile  file. To see the current value when logged on as the user, \\nsimply enter the command umask  and note what is returned. To change the \\numask  value for a user, edit the file /home/username/.profile  and, for example, \\nadd umask 007  to set it so only the user and members of the user’s group have \\npermissions. \\nSpecial Permissions\\nIn addition to the three general-purpose permissions, rwx, Linux has three \\nspecial permissions that are slightly more complicated. These special per -\\nmissions are set user ID (or SUID), set group ID (or SGID), and sticky bit. I’ll \\ndiscuss each in turn in the next three sections.\\nGranting Temporary Root Permissions with SUID\\nAs you should know by now, a user can execute a file only if they have per -\\nmission to execute that particular file. If the user only has read and/or \\nwrite permissions, they cannot execute. This may seem straightforward, \\nbut there are exceptions to this rule.\\nYou may have encountered a case in which a file requires the permis -\\nsions of the root user during execution for all users, even those who are not \\nroot. For example, a file that allows users to change their password would \\nneed access to the /etc/shadow  file—the file that holds the users’ passwords \\nin Linux—which requires root user privileges in order to execute. In such a \\ncase, you can temporarily grant the owner’s privileges to execute the file by \\nsetting the SUID bit on the program.\\nBasically, the SUID bit says that any user can execute the file with the per -\\nmissions of the owner but those permissions don’t extend beyond the use of \\nthat file.58   Chapter 5\\nTo set the SUID bit, enter a 4 before the regular permissions, so a file \\nwith a new resulting permission of 644 is represented as 4644 when the SUID \\nbit is set.\\nSetting the SUID on a file is not something a typical user would do, but if \\nyou want to do so, you’ll use the chmod  command, as in chmod 4644 filename .\\nGranting the Root User’s Group Permissions SGID\\nSGID also grants temporary elevated permissions, but it grants the permissions \\nof the file owner’s group, rather than of the file’s owner. This means that, \\nwith an SGID bit set, someone without execute permission can execute a file if \\nthe owner belongs to the group that has permission to execute that file.\\nThe SGID bit works slightly differently when applied to a directory: when \\nthe bit is set on a directory, ownership of new files created in that directory \\ngoes to the directory creator’s group, rather than the file creator’s group. \\nThis is very useful when a directory is shared by multiple users. All users in \\nthat group can execute the file(s), not just a single user.\\nThe SGID bit is represented as 2 before the regular permissions, so a new \\nfile with the resulting permissions 644 would be represented as 2644 when \\nthe SGID bit is set. Again, you would use the chmod  command for this—for \\nexample, chmod 2644 filename .\\nThe Outmoded Sticky Bit\\nThe sticky bit  is a permission bit that you can set on a directory to allow a \\nuser to delete or rename files within that directory. However, the sticky bit \\nis a legacy of older Unix systems, and modern systems (like Linux) ignore \\nit. As such, I will not discuss it further here, but you should be familiar with \\nthe term because you might hear it in the Linux world.\\nSpecial Permissions, Privilege Escalation, and the Hacker\\nAs a hacker, these special permissions can be used to exploit Linux systems \\nthrough privilege escalation , whereby a regular user gains root or sysadmin \\nprivileges and the associated permissions. With root privileges, you can do \\nanything on the system.\\nOne way to do this is to exploit the SUID bit. A system administrator or \\nsoftware developer might set the SUID bit on a program to allow that pro -\\ngram access to files with root privileges. For instance, scripts that need to \\nchange passwords often have the SUID bit set. You, the hacker, can use that \\npermission to gain temporary root privileges and do something malicious, \\nsuch as get access to the passwords at /etc/shadow .\\nLet’s look for files with the SUID bit set on our Kali system to try this \\nout. Back in Chapter 1, I introduced you to the find command. We’ll use \\nits power to find files with the SUID bit set.\\nAs you’ll remember, the find command is powerful, but the syntax is \\nbit more complicated than some of the other location commands, such as \\nlocate  and which . Take a moment to review the find syntax in Chapter 1, if \\nyou need to.Controlling File and Directory Permissions    59In this case, we want to find files anywhere on the filesystem, for the \\nroot user or other sysadmin, with the permissions 4000. To do this, we can \\nuse the following find command:\\nkali >find / -user root -perm -4000\\nWith this command, we ask Kali to start looking at the top of the file -\\nsystem with the / syntax. It then looks everywhere below / for files that are \\nowned by root, specified with user root , and that have the SUID permission \\nbit set ( -perm -4000 ).\\nWhen we run this command, we get the output shown in Listing 5-2.\\n/usr/bin/chsh\\n/usr/bin/gpasswd\\n/usr/bin/pkexec\\n/usr/bin/sudo\\n/usr/bin/passwd\\n/usr/bin/kismet_capture\\n--snip--\\nListing 5-2: Finding files with the SUID bit set\\nThe output reveals numerous files that have the SUID bit set. Let’s navi -\\ngate to the /usr/bin  directory, where many of these files reside, and then run \\na long listing on that directory and scroll down to the sudo file, as shown in \\nListing 5-3.\\nkali >cd /usr/bin\\nkali >ls -l\\n--snip--\\n-rwxr-xr-x 1  root  root  176272    Jul 18 2018    stunnel4\\n-rwxr-xr-x 1  root  root   26696    Mar 17 2018    sucrack\\nu -rwsr-xr-x 1  root  root  140944    Jul 5  2018    sudo\\n--snip--\\nListing 5-3: Identifying files with the SUID bit set\\nNote that at u, the first set of permissions—for the owner—has an s \\nin place of the x. This is how Linux represents that the SUID bit is set. This \\nmeans that anyone who runs the sudo file has the privileges of the root user, \\nwhich can be a security concern for the sysadmin and a potential attack vec -\\ntor for the hacker. For instance, some applications need to access the /etc/ \\nshadow  file to successfully complete their tasks. If the attacker can gain con -\\ntrol of that application, they can use that application’s access to the pass -\\nwords on a Linux system.\\nLinux has a well-developed system of security that protects files and \\ndirectories from unauthorized access. The aspiring hacker needs to have a \\nbasic understanding of this system not only to protect their files but also to \\nexecute new tools and files. In some cases, hackers can exploit the SUID and \\nSGID permissions to escalate privileges from a regular user to a root user.60   Chapter 5\\nSummary\\nLinux’s use of permissions to protect a user’s or group’s files and directories \\nfrom other users in the system can be used for offensive and defensive pur -\\nposes. You should now know how to manage these permissions and how to \\nexploit weak points in this security system—in particular, SUID and SGID bits.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 6, put the knowledge you learned from this \\nchapter to the test by completing the following exercises:\\n1. Select a directory and run a long listing on it. Note the permissions on the \\nfiles and directories.\\n2. Select a file you don’t have permission to execute and give yourself execute \\npermissions using the chmod  command. Try using both the numeral method \\n(777) and the UGO method.\\n3. Choose another file and change its ownership using chown .\\n4. Use the find command to find all files with the SGID bit set.6\\nPROCESS MANAGEMENT\\nAt any given time, a Linux system typically \\nhas hundreds, or sometimes even thousands, \\nof processes running simultaneously. A process  \\nis simply a program that’s running and using \\nresources. Examples of a process include a terminal, \\nweb server, any running commands, any databases, the \\nGUI interface, and much more. Any good Linux administrator—and par \\xad\\nticularly a hacker—needs to under  stand how to manage their processes to \\noptimize their systems. For example, once a hacker takes control of a target \\nsystem, they might want to find and stop a certain process, like an antivirus \\napplication or firewall. To do so, the hacker would first need to know how to \\nfind the process. The hacker might also want to set a scanning script to run \\nperiodically to find vul  nerable systems, so we’ll also look at how to schedule \\nsuch a script.\\nIn this chapter, you’ll learn to manage those processes. First, you’ll \\nlearn to view and find processes and how to discover which processes \\nare using the most resources. Then, you’ll learn to manage processes by 62   Chapter 6running them in the background, prioritizing them, and killing them if \\nnecessary (no blood involved). Finally, you’ll learn to schedule processes to \\nrun on specified days and dates and at specific times.\\nViewing Processes\\nIn most cases, the first step in managing processes is to view what processes \\nare running on your system. The primary tool for viewing processes—and \\none of the Linux administrator’s best friends—is the ps command. Run it in \\nyour command line to see what processes are active:\\nkali >ps\\nPID    TTY      TIME      CMD\\n39659  pts/0    00:00:01  bash\\n39665  pts/0    00:00:00  ps\\nThe Linux kernel , the inner core of the operating system that con\\xad\\ntrols nearly everything, assigns a unique process ID (PID)  to each process \\nsequentially, as the processes are created. When working with these processes \\nin Linux, you often need to specify their PIDs, so it is far more important to \\nnote the PID of the process than the name of the process.\\nAlone, the ps command doesn’t really provide you with much infor\\xad\\nmation. Running the ps command without any options lists the processes \\nstarted (said to be invoked ) by the currently logged \\xadin user (in our case, \\nroot) and what processes are running on that terminal. Here, it simply says \\nthat the bash shell is open and running and that we ran the ps command. \\nWe want and need far more information than that, particularly on those \\nprocesses run by other users and by the system in the background. Without \\nthis information, we know very little of what is actually taking place on our \\nsystem.\\nRunning the ps command with the options aux will show all processes \\nrunning on the system for all users, as shown in Listing 6 \\xad1. Note that you \\ndon’t prefix these options with a dash ( -) and that everything is in lower \\xad\\ncase; because Linux is case \\xadsensitive, using uppercase options would give \\nyou significantly different results.\\nkali >ps aux\\nUSER  PID   %CPU  %MEM    VSZ    RSS TTY    STAT START   TIME   COMMAND\\nroot    1    0.0   0.4    202540  6396 ?

The first process is init, listed in the Process Management    63final column, and the last process is the command we ran to display, ps aux . \\nMany of the details ( PID, %CPU, TIME, COMMAND , and so on) may be different on \\nyour system but should have the same format. For our purposes, here are \\nthe most important columns in this output:\\nUSER The user who invoked the process\\nPID The process ID\\n%CPU The percent of CPU this process is using\\n%MEM The percent of memory this process is using\\nCOMMAND  The name of the command that started the process\\nIn general, to perform any action on a process, we must specify its PID. \\nLet’s see how to use this identifier to our advantage.\\nFiltering by Process Name\\nWhen we inquire about or perform an action on processes, we usually don’t \\nwant all of the processes displayed on the screen. It’s simply a problem of \\ntoo much information. Most often, we want to find information on a single  \\nprocess. To do so, we can use the filtering command grep, which I intro \\xad\\nduced in Chapter 1.\\nTo demonstrate, we’ll use the Metasploit exploitation framework, the \\nmost widely used exploitation framework and nearly every hacker’s good \\nfriend. This comes installed on your Kali system, so start Metasploit with \\nthe following:\\nkali >msfconsole\\nOnce the exploitation framework has been started, let’s see whether \\nwe can find it in the list of processes. Metasploit has now taken over this \\nterminal, so open another terminal. Now, use the ps aux  command and \\nthen pipe it ( |) to grep looking for the string msfconsole , as in Listing 6 \\xad2.\\nkali >ps aux | grep msfconsole\\n1:36 ruby /usr/bin/msfconsole\\nroot 39892  0.0  0.0  4304  940  pts/2 S+  15:18  0:00 grep msfconsole\\nListing 6-2: Filtering a ps search to find a particular process\\nFrom the filtered output in this listing, you should see all the processes \\nthat match the term msfconsole . Here, you see the msfconsole  program itself \\nfrom /usr/bin/msfconsole , and then you should see the grep command you \\nused to look for msfconsole . Notice that the output did not include the column \\nheader list from ps. Since the keyword, msfconsole , is not in the header, it is not \\ndisplayed. Even so, the results are displayed in the same format.\\nFrom this, you can learn some important information. If, for example, \\nyou need to know how many resources Metasploit is using, you can consult 64   Chapter 6the third column (the CPU column), to see that it’s using 35.1 percent of \\nyour CPU, and consult the fourth column to see that it’s using 15.2 percent \\nof your system memory. That’s quite a bit. It’s a demanding beast!\\nFinding the Greediest Processes with top\\nWhen you enter the ps command, the processes are displayed in the order \\nthey were started, and since the kernel assigns PIDs in the order they have \\nstarted, what you see are processes ordered by PID number.\\nIn many cases, we want to know which processes are using the most \\nresources. This is where the top command comes in handy because it dis\\xad\\nplays the processes ordered by resources used, starting with the largest. \\nUnlike the ps command, which gives us a one \\xadtime snapshot of the pro\\xad\\ncesses, top refreshes the list dynamically—by default, every 3 seconds. \\nYou can watch and monitor those resource \\xadhungry processes, as shown in \\nListing 6 \\xad3.\\nkali >top\\ntop - 15:31:17 up 2 days, 6:50, 4 users, load average: 0.00, 0.04, 0.09\\nTasks: 176 total, 1 running, 175 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie\\n%Cpu(s): 1.3 us, 0.7 sy, 0.0 ni, 97.4 id, 0.0 wa, 0.0 hi 0.0 si 0.0\\nMiB Mem : 1491220 total,  64848 free, 488272 used, 938100 buff/cache\\nMiB Swap : 1046524 total, 1044356 free, 2168 used. 784476 avail MEM\\nPID   USER  PR  NI   VIRT    RES     SHR    S  %CPU  %MEM   TIME+    COMMAND\\n39759 root  20   0   893180  247232  11488  S  0.7   16.6   1:47.88  ruby\\n39859 root  20   0   27308   16796   14272  S  0.3   1.2    1:47.88  postgres\\n39933 root  20   0   293936  61500   29108  S  0.7   4.1    1:47.88  Xorg\\n--snip--\\nListing 6-3: Finding the greediest processes with top\\nSystem administrators often keep top running in a terminal to monitor \\nuse of process resources.

You’ll use top again soon to manage \\nyour processes in “Changing Process Priority with nice” on page 65  and \\n“Killing Processes” on page 66 .\\nManaging Processes\\nHackers often need to multiprocess, and an operating system like Kali is \\nideal for this. The hacker may have a port scanner running while running \\na vulnerability scanner and an exploit simultaneously. This requires that \\nthe hacker manage these processes efficiently to best use system resources \\nand complete the task. In this section, I\\'ll show you how to manage multiple \\nprocesses.Process Management    65Changing Process Priority with nice\\nYou don’t often hear the word nice used in the context of hackers, but here \\nyou will. The nice command is used to influence the priority of a process to \\nthe kernel. As you saw when we ran the ps command, numerous processes \\nrun on the system at once, and all of them are contending for the available \\nresources. The kernel will have final say over the priority of a process, but \\nyou can use nice to suggest  that a process should be elevated in priority.\\nThe idea behind the use of the term nice is that, when you use it, you’re \\ndetermining how “nice” you’ll be to other users: if your process is using most \\nof the system resources, you aren’t being very nice.\\nThe values for nice range from −20 to +19, with zero being the default \\nvalue (see Figure 6 \\xad1). A high nice value translates to a low priority, and a \\nlow nice value translates to a high priority (when you’re not being so nice \\nto other users and processes). When a process is started, it inherits the nice \\nvalue of its parent process. The owner of the process can lower the priority \\nof the process but cannot increase its priority. Of course, the superuser or \\nroot user can arbitrarily set the nice value to whatever they please.\\n0 −20 +19\\nDefault\\nnice valueLeast likely to\\nreceive priorityMost likely to\\nreceive priority\\nFigure 6-1: Niceness priority values\\nWhen you start a process, you can set the priority level with the nice \\ncommand and then alter the priority after the process has started run \\xad\\nning with the renice  command. The syntax for these two commands is \\nslightly different and can be confusing. The nice command requires that \\nyou increment  the nice value, whereas the renice  command wants an absolute \\nvalue  for niceness. Let’s look at an example to demonstrate this.\\nSetting the Priority When Starting a Process\\nFor demonstration purposes, let’s assume we have a process named \\nslowprocess  that’s located at /bin/slowprocess . If we wanted it to speed up \\nits completion, we could start the process with the nice command:\\nkali >nice  -n -10 /bin/slowprocess\\nThis command would increment the nice value by -10, increasing its \\n priority and allocating it more resources.\\nOn the other hand, if we want to be nice to our fellow users and pro \\xad\\ncesses and give slowprocess  a lower priority, we could increment its nice value \\npositively by 10:\\nkali >nice -n 10 /bin/slowprocess66   Chapter 6Give this a try on a process you have currently running and then run ps \\nto see how it changes, if at all.\\nChanging the Priority of a Running Process with renice\\nThe renice  command takes absolute values between –20 and 19 and sets \\nthe priority to that particular level, rather than increasing or decreasing \\nfrom the level at which it started. In addition, renice  requires the PID of the \\nprocess you are targeting rather than the name. So, if slowprocess  is using \\nan inordinate amount of resources on your system and you want to give it \\na lower priority, thus allowing other processes a higher priority and more \\nresources, you could renice  the slowprocess  (which has a PID of 6996) and \\ngive it a much higher nice value, like so:\\nkali >renice 19 6996\\nAs with nice, only the root user can renice  a process to a negative value \\nto give it higher priority, but any user can be nice and reduce priority with \\nrenice .\\nYou can also use the top utility to change the nice value. With the top \\nutility running, simply press the R key and then supply the PID and the nice \\nvalue. Listing 6 \\xad4 shows the top utility running. When I press the R key and \\nsupply the PID and nice value, I get the following output:\\ntop - 21:36:56 up 21:41,  2 users, load average: 0.60, 0.22, 0.11\\nTasks: 128 total,  1 running, 127 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie\\n%Cpu(s): 1.5 us, 0.7 sy, 0.0 ni, 96.7 id, 1.1 wa, 0.0 hi, 0.0 si, 0.0 st\\nKiB Mem:  511864 total,  500780 used, 11084 free,  152308 buffers\\nKiB Swap:  901116 total,  14444 used,  886672 free,  171376 cached\\nu PID to renice\\n|\\nPID   USER  PR  NI  VIRT   RES   SHR   S  %CPU  %MEM  TIME      COMMAND\\n5451  root  20  0   1577m  19m   14m   S  5.3   3.9   42:46.26  0LLYDBG.EXE\\n2766  root  20  0   55800  20m   5480  S  2.6   4.0   1:01.42   Xorg\\n5456  root  20  0   6356   4272  1780  S  1.3   0.8   13:21.69  wineserver\\n7     root  20  0   0      0     0     S  0.3   0.0   0:30.12   rcu_sched\\n5762  root  20  0   174m   20m   17m   S  0.3   4.1   0:04.74   gnome-terminal\\nListing 6-4: Changing a nice value when top is in use\\nWhen I press the R key, I’m asked for the PID u with the text renice  \\nPID [value] to value . The output should then change to reflect the new \\npriorities.\\nKilling Processes\\nAt times, a process will consume way too many system resources, exhibit \\nunusual behavior, or  —at worst—freeze. A process that exhibits this type of \\nbehavior is often referred to as a rogue process . For you, probably the most \\nproblematic symptom will be wasted resources used by the rogue process \\nthat could be better allocated to useful processes.Process Management    67When you identify a problematic process, you may want to stop it with \\nthe kill command. There are many different ways to kill a program, and \\neach has its own kill number.\\nThe kill command has 64 different kill signals, and each does some \\xad\\nthing slightly different. Here, we focus on a few you will likely find most \\nuseful. The syntax for the kill command is kill-signal PID, where the signal \\nswitch is optional. If you don’t provide a signal flag, it defaults to SIGTERM . \\nTable 6 \\xad1 lists the common kill signals\\nTable 6-1: Commonly Used Kill Signals\\nSignal name Number \\nfor optionDescription\\nSIGHUP 1 This is known as the Hangup (HUP)  signal. It stops the des -\\nignated process and restarts it with the same PID.\\nSIGINT 2 This is the Interrupt (INT)  signal. It is a weak kill signal that \\nisn’t guaranteed to work, but it works in most cases.\\nSIGQUIT 3 This is known as the core dump . It terminates the process \\nand saves the process information in memory, and then it \\nsaves this information in the current working directory to \\na file named core. (The reasons for doing this are beyond \\nthe scope of this book.)\\nSIGTERM 15 This is the Termination (TERM)  signal. It is the kill com-\\nmand’s default kill signal.\\nSIGKILL 9 This is the absolute kill signal. It forces the process to \\nstop by sending the process’s resources to a special \\ndevice, /dev/null .\\nUsing the top command, you can identify which processes are using too \\nmany resources; often, those processes will be legitimate, but there may be \\nmalicious processes taking resources that you’ll want to kill.\\nIf you just want to restart a process with the HUP signal, enter the -1 \\noption with kill, like so:\\nkali >kill -1 6996\\nIn the case of a rogue or a malicious process, you likely want to send \\nthe kill -9  signal, the absolute kill signal, to the process. This makes cer \\xad\\ntain that the process is terminated.\\nkali >kill -9 6996\\nIf you don’t know a process’s PID, you can use the killall  command to \\nkill the process. This command takes the name of the process, instead of \\nthe PID, as an argument. 68   Chapter 6For example, you could terminate a hypothetical rogueprocess  like this:\\nkali >killall -9 rogueprocess\\nFinally, you can also terminate a process in the top command. Simply \\npress the K key and then enter the PID of the offending process.\\nRunning Processes in the Background\\nIn Linux, whether you’re working from the command line or the GUI, \\nyou’re working within a shell. All commands that run are executed from \\nwithin that shell, even if they run from the graphical interface. When you \\nexecute a command, the shell waits until the command is completed before \\noffering another command prompt.\\nAt times, you may want a process to run in the background, rather than \\nhaving to wait for it to complete in that terminal. For instance, say we want \\nto work on a script in a text editor and so have called our text editor (leaf \\xad\\npad) by entering the following:\\nkali >leafpad newscript\\nIn this case, the bash shell will open the leafpad text editor to create \\nnewscript . While we work in the text editor, the terminal is occupied with \\nrunning the text editor. If we return to the terminal, we should see that it \\nis running our text editor and that we have no new prompt to allow us to \\nenter more commands.\\nWe could, of course, open another terminal to run more commands, \\nbut a better option to save resources and screen real estate is to start the \\ntext editor running in the background. Running a process in the back \\xad\\nground simply means that it will continue to run without needing the ter \\xad\\nminal. In this way, the terminal is freed up for other duties.\\nTo start the text editor in the background, just append an ampersand \\n(&) to the end of the command, like so:\\nkali >leafpad newscript &\\nNow, when the text editor opens, the terminal returns a new command \\nprompt so we can enter other commands on our system while also editing \\nour newscript . This is effective for any process that may run for a significant \\nlength of time when you want use the terminal. As a hacker, you’ll find this \\nuseful for running multiple terminals with multiple tasks, to save resources \\nand screen space.\\nYou can also move a process to the background using the bg command \\nfollowed by the PID of the process. If you don’t know the PID, you can use \\nthe ps command to find it.Process Management    69Moving a Process to the Foreground\\nIf you want to move a process running in the background to the fore\\xad\\nground, you can use the fg (foreground) command. The fg command \\nrequires the PID of the process you want to return to the foreground, as \\nshown next.\\nkali >fg 1234\\nIf you don’t know the PID, you can use the ps command to find it.\\nScheduling Processes\\nBoth Linux system administrators and hackers often need to schedule \\nprocesses to run at a particular time of day. A system administrator might \\nwant to schedule a system backup to run every Saturday night at 2 am, for \\n example. A hacker might want to set a script to run to perform reconnais \\xad\\nsance on a regular basis, finding open ports or vulnerabilities. In Linux, \\nyou can accomplish this in at least two ways: with at and crond .\\nThe at command is used to set up the daemon —a background process—\\natd, which is useful for scheduling a job to run once at some point in the \\nfuture. The crond  daemon is more suited for scheduling tasks to occur every \\nday, week, or month, and we’ll cover this in detail in Chapter 16.\\nWe use the at daemon to schedule the execution of a command or set \\nof commands in the future. The syntax is simply the at command followed \\nby the time to execute the process. The time argument can be provided in \\nvarious formats. Table 6 \\xad2 contains the most common at time formats.\\nTable 6-2: Time Formats Accepted by the at Command\\nTime format Meaning\\nat 7:20pm Scheduled to run at 7:20 pm on the current day\\nat 7:20pm June 25 Scheduled to run at 7:20 pm on June 25\\nat noon Scheduled to run at noon on the current day\\nat noon June 25 Scheduled to run at noon on June 25\\nat tomorrow Scheduled to run tomorrow\\nat now + 20 minutes Scheduled to run in 20 minutes from the current time\\nat now + 10 hours Scheduled to run in 10 hours from the current time\\nat now + 5 days Scheduled to run in five days from the current date\\nat now + 3 weeks Scheduled to run in three weeks from the current date\\nat 7:20pm 06/25/2019 Scheduled to run at 7:20 pm on June 25, 201970   Chapter 6\\nWhen you enter the at daemon with the specified time, at goes into \\ninteractive mode and you are greeted with an at> prompt. Here is where \\nyou enter the command you want executed at the specified time:\\nkali >at 7:20am\\nat >/root/myscanningscript\\nThis code snippet will schedule myscanningscript  to execute today at \\n7:20 am. When you want to stop entering commands, hit ctrl \\xadD.\\nSummary\\nManaging processes in Linux is a key skill for every Linux user and hacker. \\nYou must be able to view, find, kill, prioritize, and schedule processes to \\nmanage your Linux instance optimally. A hacker often will need to find \\nprocesses on the target they want to kill, such as the antivirus software or a \\nfirewall. They will also need to manage multiple processes in an attack and \\nprioritize them. \\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 7 , try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. Run the ps command with the aux options on your system and note which \\nprocess is first and which is last.\\n2. Run the top command and note the two processes using the greatest \\namount of your resources.\\n3. Use the kill command to kill the process that uses the most resources.\\n4. Use the renice  command to reduce the priority of a running process \\nto +19.\\n5. Create a script called myscanning  (to see how to write a bash script, see \\nChapter 8; the content of the script is not important) with a text editor and \\nthen schedule it to run next Wednesday at 1 AM.7\\nMANAGING USER  \\nENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES\\nTo get the most from your Linux hacking \\nsystem, you need to understand environ -\\nment variables and be adept at managing \\nthem for optimal performance, convenience, \\nand even stealth. Among the areas that Linux new -\\ncomers find problematic, however, managing the user \\nenvironment variables might be the most difficult to \\nmaster. Technically, there are two types of variables: shell and environment. \\nEnvironment variables  are process-wide variables built into your system and \\ninterface that control the way your system looks, acts, and “feels” to the \\nuser, and they are inherited by any child shells or processes. Shell variables , \\non the other hand, are typically listed in lowercase and are only valid in the \\nshell they are set in. To avoid over-explanation, I just cover some of the most \\nbasic and useful skills for environment and shell variables in this chapter.72   Chapter 7Variables are simply strings in key-value pairs. Generally, each pair will \\nlook like KEY=value . In cases where there are multiple values, they will look \\nlike KEY=value1:value2 . As with most things in Linux, if there are spaces in the \\nvalue, it needs to be contained in quotation marks. In Kali Linux, your envi -\\nronment is your bash shell. Each user, including root, has a default set of \\nenvironment variables that determine how the system looks, acts, and feels. \\nYou can change the values for these variables to make your system work \\nmore efficiently, tailor your work environment to best meet your individual \\nneeds, and potentially cover your tracks if you need to.\\nViewing and Modifying Environment Variables\\nYou can view all your default environment variables by entering env into \\nyour terminal from any directory:\\nkali >env\\nXDG_VTNR=7\\nSSHAGENT_PID=922\\nXDG_SESSION_ID=2\\nXDG_GREETER_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/lightdm/data/root\\nGLADE_PIXMAP_PATH=:echo\\nTERM=xterm-256color\\nSHELL=/bin/bash\\n--snip--\\nUSER=root\\n--snip--\\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin :usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/bin\\n--snip--\\nHOME=/root\\n--snip--\\nEnvironment variables are always uppercase, as in HOME, PATH, SHELL , and \\nso on. These are only the default environment variables that come on your \\nsystem. A user can also create their own variables, and as you will see, we \\nneed a different command to include those in the output.\\nViewing All Environment Variables\\nTo view all environment variables, including shell variables, local vari -\\nables, and shell functions such as any user-defined variables and command \\naliases, use the set command. This command will list all environment vari -\\nables unique to your system, which in most cases will give you an output so \\nlong you won’t be able to view it all on a single screen. You can request to \\nview each variable, line by line, in a more accessible fashion using set and \\npiping it to the more command, as follows:\\nkali >set | more\\nBASH=/bin/bash\\nBASHOPTS=checkwinsize:cmdlist:complete_fullquote:expand_aliases:extglob.....Managing User Environment  Variables   73BASH_ALIASES=()\\nBASH_ARGC=([0] = \"0\")\\nBASH_ARGV=()\\n--snip--\\nNow the list of variables will fill up one screen, line by line, and then stop. \\nWhen you press enter , the terminal advances to the next line, taking you \\nto the next variable, so you can scroll through by pressing or holding enter . \\nAs you might recall from Chapter 2, whenever you use the more command \\nfor output, you can enter q to quit (or exit) and return to the command \\nprompt.\\nFiltering for Particular Variables\\nAlthough using set with more gives more manageable results than looking \\nthrough the huge chunk of variable names you get with set alone, it can still \\nbe rather tedious if you’re looking for a particular variable. Instead, you can \\nuse the filtering command grep to find your variable of interest.\\nLet’s use the variable HISTSIZE  as an example. This variable contains \\nthe maximum number of commands your command history file will store. \\nThese commands are any ones you’ve previously typed into your command \\nprompt in this session and can be recalled with your up- and down-arrow \\nkeys. Note that HISTSIZE  doesn’t store the commands themselves, just the \\nnumber of them that can be stored.\\nPipe your set output with grep to find the HISTSIZE  variable, like so:\\nkali >set | grep HISTSIZE\\nHISTSIZE=1000\\nAs you can see, this command finds the variable HISTSIZE  and displays \\nits value. The default value of this variable is probably set to 1000 on your \\nsystem. This indicates that the terminal will store your last 1,000 commands \\nby default.\\nChanging Variable Values for a Session\\nNow let’s see how to change a variable’s value. As noted, the HISTSIZE  variable \\ncontains the value of the number of commands to store in the history file. \\nSometimes, you won’t want your system to save past commands—perhaps \\nbecause you don’t want to leave any evidence of your activity on your own \\nsystem or a target system. In that case, you can set the HISTSIZE  variable to 0 \\nso the system won’t store any of your past commands. Because this variable \\nhas a single value, to change it, you assign it a new value in the familiar way \\nshown in Listing 7-1.\\nkali >HISTSIZE=0\\nListing 7-1: Changing the value of HISTSIZE74   Chapter 7Now, when you try to use the up- and down-arrow keys to recall your \\ncommands, nothing happens because the system no longer stores them. \\nThis is stealthy, although it can be inconvenient.\\nMaking Variable Value Changes Permanent\\nWhen you change an environment variable, that change only occurs in that \\nparticular environment; in this case, that environment is the bash shell \\nsession. This means that when you close the terminal, any changes you \\nmade are lost, with values set back to their defaults. If you want to make the \\nchanges permanent, you need to use the export  command. This command \\nwill export  the new value from your current environment (the bash shell) to \\nany new forked child processes. This allows the new process to inherit the \\nexported variables.\\nVariables are strings, so if you run on the cautious side, it isn’t a bad \\nidea to save the contents of a variable to a text file before you modify it. \\nFor example, since we’re about to change the PS1 variable, which controls \\nthe information you display in the prompt, first run the following com -\\nmand to save the existing values to a text file in the current user’s home \\ndirectory:\\nkali >echo $HISTSIZE> ~/valueofHISTSIZE.txt\\nThis way, you can always undo your changes. If you want to be even \\nmore cautious and create a text file with all the current settings, you can \\nsave the output of the set command to a text file with a command like \\nthis one:\\nkali >set> ~/valueofALLon01012019.txt\\nAfter you’ve changed a variable, as we did in Listing 7-1, you can make \\nthe change permanent by entering export  and then the name of the variable \\nyou changed, as shown here:\\nkali >export HISTSIZE\\nNow the HISTSIZE  variable will still be set to 0 in this environment and \\nwill no longer store your commands. If you want to reset the HISTSIZE  vari-\\nable to 1,000, simply enter this:\\nkali >HISTSIZE=1000\\nkali >export HISTSIZE\\nThis code snippet will set your HISTSIZE  variable’s value to 1,000 and \\nexport it to all your environments.Managing User Environment  Variables   75Changing Your Shell Prompt\\nYour shell prompt, another environment variable, provides you with useful \\ninformation such as the user you’re operating as and the directory in which \\nyou’re currently working. The default shell prompt in Kali takes the follow -\\ning format:\\nusername@hostname: current_directory  #\\nIf you’re working as the root user, this translates to the following \\ndefault prompt:\\nroot@kali: current_directory  #\\nYou can change the name in the default shell prompt by setting the \\nvalue for the PS1 variable. The PS1 variable has a set of placeholders for \\ninformation you want to display in the prompt, including the following:\\n\\\\u The name of the current user\\n\\\\h The hostname\\n\\\\w The base name of the current working directory\\nThis is very useful if you happen to have shells on multiple systems or \\nare logged on as multiple accounts. By using the \\\\u and \\\\h values, you can \\ntell at a glance who you are and what your current system is.\\nLet’s have a little fun and change the prompt in your terminal. For \\nexample, you could enter the following:\\nkali >PS1=\"World\\'s Best Hacker: #\"\\nWorld\\'s Best Hacker: #\\nNow, every time you use this terminal, you’ll be reminded that you are \\nthe “World’s Best Hacker.” But any subsequent terminal you open will still \\nhave the default command prompt, because the PS1 variable only holds val -\\nues for your terminal session. Remember, until you export a variable, it is \\nonly good for that session. If you really like this new command prompt and \\nwant to continue to use it, you need to export it, like so:\\nkali >export PS1\\nHow about a little more fun? Say you really want your terminal to look \\nlike a Windows cmd prompt. In this case, you could change the prompt name \\nto C: and keep the \\\\w to have the prompt show your current directory, as \\nshown in Listing 7-2.76   Chapter 7kali >export PS1=\\'C:\\\\w> \\'\\nkali >cd /tmp\\nC:/tmp>\\nListing 7-2: Changing the prompt and showing the current directory\\nHaving your prompt show your current directory can be generally \\nuseful, particularly to a beginner, so it’s something to consider when you \\nchange your PS1 variable.\\nChanging Your PATH\\nOne of the most important variables in your environment is your PATH vari-\\nable, which controls where on your system your shell will look for commands \\nyou enter, such as grep, ls, and echo. Most commands are located in the sbin \\nor bin subdirectory, like /usr/local/sbin  or /usr/local/bin . If the bash shell \\ndoesn’t find the command in one of the directories in your PATH variable, it \\nwill return the error command not found , even if that command does exist in a \\ndirectory not in your PATH.\\nYou can find out which directories are stored in your PATH variable by \\nusing echo on its contents, like so:\\nkali >echo $PATH\\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\\nThese are the directories where your terminal will search for any com -\\nmand. When you enter ls, for example, the system knows to look in each \\nof these directories for the ls command, and when it finds ls, the system \\nexecutes it.\\nEach directory is separated by a colon ( :). Don’t forget to add the $ \\ncontent symbol to PATH. When we put a $ before a variable, we are asking the \\nsystem for the content of the variable.\\nAdding to the PATH Variable\\nYou can probably see why it’s important to know what is in your PATH vari -\\nable: if you downloaded and installed a new tool—let’s say newhackingtool —\\ninto the /root/newhackingtool  directory, you could only use commands from \\nthat tool when you’re in that directory because that directory is not in the \\nPATH variable. Every time you wanted to use that tool, you would first have to \\nnavigate to /root/newhackingtool , which is a bit inconvenient if you want to \\nuse the tool often.\\nTo be able to use this new tool from any directory, you need to add the \\ndirectory holding this tool to your PATH variable.\\nTo add newhackingtool  to your PATH variable, enter the following:\\nkali >PATH=$PATH:/root/newhackingtoolManaging User Environment  Variables   77This assigns the original PATH variable plus the /root/newhackingtool  \\ndirectory to the new PATH variable, so the variable contains everything it did \\nbefore, plus the new tool directory.\\nIf you examine the contents of the PATH variable again, you should see \\nthat this directory has been appended to the end of PATH, as shown here:\\nkali >echo $PATH\\n/usr/local/sbin:usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/bin:/root/newhackingtool\\nNow you can execute newhackingtool  applications from anywhere on \\nyour system, rather than having to navigate to its directory. The bash shell \\nwill look in all directories listed for your new tool!\\nNOTE  Adding to PATH can be a useful technique for directories you use often, but be careful \\nnot to add too many directories to your PATH variable. Because the system will have to \\nsearch through each and every directory in PATH to find commands, adding a lot of \\ndirectories could slow down your terminal and your hacking.\\nHow Not to Add to the PATH Variable\\nOne mistake commonly made by new Linux users is assigning a new direc -\\ntory, such as /root/newhackingtool , directly to the PATH variable in this way:\\nkali >PATH=/root/newhackingtool\\nkali >echo $PATH\\n/root/newhackingtool\\nIf you use this command, your PATH variable will only contain the /root/\\nnewhackingtool  directory and no longer contain the system binaries direc -\\ntories such as /bin, /sbin , and others that hold critical commands. When \\nyou then go to use any of the system commands, you’ll receive the error \\ncommand not found , as shown next, unless you first navigate to the system \\nbinaries directory when you execute the command:\\nkali >ls\\nbash: ls: command not found\\nRemember that you want to append  to the PATH variable, not replace it. \\nIf you’re in doubt, save the contents of the variable somewhere before you \\nmodify it.\\nCreating a User-Defined Variable\\nYou can create your own custom, user-defined variables in Linux by simply \\nassigning a value to a new variable that you name. This may be useful when \\nyou are doing some more advanced shell scripting or find you’re often using \\na long command that you get tired of typing over and over.78   Chapter 7The syntax is straightforward: enter the name of your variable, followed \\nby the assignment symbol ( =) without a space, and then the value to put in \\nthe variable, as shown here:\\nkali >MYNEWVARIABLE=\"Hacking is the most valuable skill set in the 21st century\"\\nThis assigns a string to the variable MYNEWVARIABLE . To see the value in \\nthat variable, use the echo command and the $ content symbol with the vari -\\nable name, as we did earlier:\\nkali >echo $MYNEWVARIABLE\\nHacking is the most valuable skill set in the 21st century\\nJust like our system environment variables, user-defined variables must \\nbe exported to persist to new sessions.\\nIf you want to delete this new variable, or any variable, use the unset  \\ncommand. Always think before deleting a system variable, though, because \\nyour system will probably operate much differently afterward.\\nkali >unset MYNEWVARIABLE\\nkali >echo $MYNEWVARIABLE\\nkali >\\nAs you can see, when you enter unset MYNEWVARIABLE , you delete the vari -\\nable along with its value. If you use echo on that same variable, Linux will \\nnow return a blank line.\\nSummary\\nYou might find environment variables foreign, but it’s worth getting to know \\nthem. They control how your working environment in Linux looks, acts, \\nand feels. You can manage these variables to tailor your environment to \\nyour needs by changing them, exporting them, and even creating your own. \\nIn some cases, they may be useful for covering your tracks as a hacker.Managing User Environment  Variables   79EXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 8, try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. View all of your environment variables with the more command.\\n2. Use the echo command to view the HOSTNAME  variable.\\n3. Find a method to change the slash ( /) to a backslash ( \\\\) in the faux \\nMicrosoft cmd PS1  example (see Listing 7-2).\\n4. Create a variable named MYNEWVARIABLE  and put your name in it.\\n5. Use echo to view the contents of MYNEWVARIABLE .\\n6. Export MYNEWVARIABLE  so that it’s available in all environments.\\n7. Use the echo command to view the contents of the PATH variable.\\n8. Add your home directory to the PATH variable so that any binaries in your \\nhome directory can be used in any directory.\\n9. Change your PS1 variable to \"World\\'s Greatest Hacker:\" .8\\nBASH SCRIPTING\\nAny self-respecting hacker must be able \\nto write scripts. For that matter, any self-\\nrespecting Linux administrator must be \\nable to script. Hackers often need to automate \\ncommands, sometimes from multiple tools, and this \\nis most efficiently done through short programs they \\nwrite themselves.\\nIn this chapter, we build a few simple bash shell scripts to start you off \\nwith scripting. We’ll add capabilities and features as we progress, eventually \\nbuilding a script capable of finding potential attack targets over a range of \\nIP addresses.\\nTo become an elite hacker, you also need the ability to script in one of \\nthe widely used scripting languages, such as Ruby (Metasploit exploits are \\nwritten in Ruby), Python (many hacking tools are Python scripts), or Perl \\n(Perl is the best text-manipulation scripting language). I give a brief intro -\\nduction to Python scripting in Chapter 17.82   Chapter 8A Crash Course in Bash\\nA shell is an interface between the user and the operating system that enables \\nyou to manipulate files and run commands, utilities, programs, and much \\nmore. The advantage of a shell is that you perform these tasks immediately \\nfrom the computer and not through an abstraction, like a GUI, which allows \\nyou to customize your task to your needs. A number of different shells are \\navailable for Linux, including the Korn shell, the Z shell, the C shell, and \\nthe Bourne- again shell, more widely known as bash.\\nBecause the bash shell is available on nearly all Linux and UNIX distri -\\nbutions (including macOS and Kali), we’ll be using the bash shell, exclusively.\\nThe bash shell can run any system commands, utilities, or applications \\nyour usual command line can run, but it also includes some of its own built-\\nin commands. Table 8-1 later in the chapter gives you a reference to some \\nuseful commands that reside within the bash shell.\\nIn earlier chapters, you used the cd, pwd, set, and umask  commands. In \\nthis section, you will be using two more commands: the echo command, first \\nused in Chapter 7, which displays messages to the screen, and the read com -\\nmand, which reads in data and stores it somewhere else. Just learning these \\ntwo commands alone will enable you to build a simple but powerful tool.\\nYou’ll need a text editor to create shell scripts. A text editor is a pro -\\ngram that can edit plain, unformatted text, like Notepad in Windows or \\nTextEdit in macOS. You can use whichever Linux text editor you like best. \\nPopular hacker choices include vi, vim, emacs, gedit, kate, and so on. I’ll be \\nusing Leafpad in this book, as I have in previous chapters. Using a different \\neditor should not make any difference in your script or its functionality.\\nYour First Script: “Hello, Hackers-Arise!”\\nFor your first script, we will start with a simple program that returns a \\nmessage to the screen that says \"Hello, Hackers-Arise!\"  Open your text \\neditor, and let’s go.\\nTo start, you need to tell your operating system which interpreter you \\nwant to use for the script. To do this, enter a shebang , which is a combina -\\ntion of a hash mark and an exclamation mark, like so:\\n#!\\nYou then follow the shebang ( #!) with /bin/bash  to indicate that you want \\nthe operating system to use the bash shell interpreter. As you’ll see in later \\nchapters, you could also use the shebang to use other interpreters, such \\nas Perl or Python. Here, you want to use the bash interpreter, so enter the \\nfollowing:\\n#! /bin/bashBash Scripting    83Next, enter the echo command, which tells the system to simply repeat \\n(or echo) back to your monitor whatever follows the command.\\nIn this case, we want the system to echo back to us \"Hello, Hackers-Arise!\" , \\nas done in Listing 8-1. Note that the text or message we want to echo back \\nmust be in double quotation marks.\\n#! /bin/bash\\n# This is my first bash script. Wish me luck.\\necho \"Hello, Hackers-Arise!\"\\nListing 8-1: Your “Hello, Hackers-Arise!” script\\nHere, you also see a line that’s preceded by a hash mark ( #). This is a \\ncomment , which is a note you leave to yourself or anyone else reading the \\ncode to explain what you’re doing in the script. Programmers use com -\\nments in every coding language. These comments are not read or executed \\nby the interpreter, so you don’t need to worry about messing up your code. \\nThey are visible only to humans. The bash shell knows a line is a comment \\nif it starts with the # character.\\nNow, save this file as HelloHackersArise  with no extension and exit your \\ntext editor.\\nSetting Execute Permissions\\nBy default, a newly created bash script is not executable even by you, the \\nowner. Let’s look at the permissions on our new file in the command line by \\nusing cd to move into the directory and then entering ls -l . It should look \\nsomething like this:\\nkali >ls -l\\n--snip--\\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 90 Oct 22 14:32 HelloHackersArise\\n--snip--\\nAs you can see, our new file has rw-r--r--  (644) permissions. As you \\nlearned in Chapter 5, this means the owner of this file only has read ( r) \\nand write ( w) permissions, but no execute ( x) permissions. The group and \\nall other users have only read permissions. We need to give ourselves exe -\\ncute permissions in order to run this script. We change the permissions \\nwith the chmod  command, as you saw in Chapter 5. To give the owner, the \\ngroup, and all others execute permissions, enter the following:\\nkali >chmod 755 HelloHackersArise84   Chapter 8Now when we do a long listing on the file, like so, we can see that we \\nhave execute permissions:\\nkali >ls -l\\n--snip--\\n-rwx r-x r-x 1 root root 42 Oct 22 14:32 HelloHackersArise\\n--snip--\\nThe file will also be in green, another indicator of its execute permis -\\nsions. The script is now ready to run!\\nRunning HelloHackersArise\\nTo run our simple script, enter the following:\\nkali >./HelloHackersArise\\nThe ./ before the filename tells the system that we want to execute \\nthis script in the file HelloHackersArise  from the current directory. It also \\ntells the system that if there is another file in another directory named \\nHelloHackersArise , please ignore it and only run HelloHackersArise  in the cur -\\nrent directory. It may seem unlikely that there’s another file with this name \\non your system, but it’s good practice to use the ./ when executing files, as \\nthis localizes the file execution to the current directory and many directo -\\nries will have duplicate filenames, such as start and setup .\\nWhen we press enter , our very simple script returns our message to the \\nmonitor:\\nHello, Hackers-Arise!\\nSuccess! You just completed your first shell script!\\nAdding Functionality with Variables and User Input\\nSo, now we have a simple script. All it does is echo back a message to stan -\\ndard output. If we want to create more advanced scripts, we will likely need \\nto add some variables.\\nA variable  is an area of storage that can hold something in memory. \\nThat “something” might be some letters or words (strings) or numbers. It’s \\nknown as a variable because the values held within it are changeable; this is \\nan extremely useful feature for adding functionality to a script.\\nIn our next script, we will add functionality to prompt the user for their \\nname, place whatever they input into a variable, then prompt the user for \\nthe chapter they’re at in this book, and place that keyboard input into a \\nvariable. After that, we’ll echo a welcome message that includes their name \\nand the chapter back to the user.\\nOpen a new file in your text editor and enter the script shown in \\nListing  8-2.Bash Scripting    85u #! /bin/bash\\nv # This is your second bash script. In this one, you prompt \\n# the user for input, place the input in a variable, and \\n# display the variable contents in a string.\\nw echo \"What is your name?\"\\nread name\\nx echo \"What chapter are you on in Linux Basics for Hackers?\"\\nread chapter\\ny echo \"Welcome $name to Chapter $chapter of Linux Basics for Hackers!\"\\nListing 8-2: A simple script making use of variables\\nWe open with #! /bin/bash  to tell the system we want to use the bash inter -\\npreter for this script u. We then add a comment that describes the script and \\nits functionality v. After that, we prompt the user for their name and ask \\nthe interpreter to read the input and place it into a variable we call name w. \\nThen we prompt the user to enter the chapter they are currently working \\nthrough in this book, and we again read the keyboard input into a variable, \\nthis time called chapter  x.\\nIn the final line, we construct a line of output that welcomes the reader \\nby their name to the chapter they are on y. We use the echo command and \\nprovide the text we want to display on the screen in double quotes. Then, to \\nfill in the name and chapter number the user entered, we add the variables \\nwhere they should appear in the message. As noted in Chapter 7, to use the \\nvalues contained in the variables, you must precede the variable name with \\nthe $ symbol.\\nSave this file as WelcomeScript.sh . The .sh extension is the convention for \\nscript files. You might have noticed we didn’t include the extension earlier; \\nit’s not strictly required, and it makes no difference if you leave the exten -\\nsion off. The extension can be a useful indicator for other people that this \\nfile is a shell script, though.\\nNow, let’s run this script. Don’t forget to give yourself execute permis -\\nsion with chmod  first; otherwise, the operating system will scold you with a \\nPermission denied  message.\\nkali >./WelcomeScript.sh\\nWhat is your name?\\nOccupytheWeb\\nWhat chapter are you on in Linux Basics for Hackers?\\n8\\nWelcome OccupytheWeb to Chapter 8 of Linux Basics for Hackers!\\nAs you can see, your script took input from the user, placed it into vari -\\nables, and then used those inputs to make a greeting for the user.86   Chapter 8This is a simple script, but it taught you how to use variables and take \\ninput from the keyboard. These are both crucial concepts in scripting that \\nyou will need to use in more complex scripts in future.\\nYour Very First Hacker Script: Scan for Open Ports\\nNow that you have some basic scripting skills, let’s move to some slightly \\nmore advanced scripting that has real-world application to hacking. We’ll \\nuse an example from the world of black hat hacking. Black hat hackers are \\nthose with malicious intentions, such as stealing credit card numbers or \\ndefacing websites. White hat hackers are those with good intentions, such \\nas helping software developers or system administrators make their systems \\nmore secure. Gray hat hackers are those who tend to move between these \\ntwo extremes.\\nBefore you continue, you need to become familiar with a simple yet \\nessential tool named nmap that comes installed on Kali by default. You’ve \\nlikely heard the name; nmap is used to probe a system to see whether it \\nis connected to the network and finds out what ports are open. From the \\nopen ports discovered, you can surmise what services are running on the \\ntarget system. This is a crucial skill for any hacker or system administrator.\\nIn its simplest form, the syntax for running an nmap scan looks like this:\\nnmap <type of scan><target IP><optionally, target port>\\nNot too difficult. The simplest and most reliable nmap scan is the TCP \\nconnect scan, designated with the -sT switch in nmap. So, if you wanted to \\nscan IP address 192.168.181.1 with a TCP scan, you would enter the following:\\nnmap -sT 192.168.181.1\\nTo take things a step further, if you wanted to perform a TCP scan of \\naddress 192.168.181.1, looking to see whether port 3306 (the default port \\nfor MySQL) was open, you could enter this:\\nnmap -sT 192.168.181.1 -p 3306\\nHere, -p designates the port you want to scan for. Go ahead and try it \\nout now on your Kali system.\\nOur Task\\nAt the time of this writing, there is a hacker serving time in US federal prison \\nby the name of Max Butler, also known as Max Vision throughout the hacker \\nworld. Max was a kind of gray hat hacker. By day, he was an IT security profes -\\nsional in Silicon Valley, and by night, he was stealing and selling credit card \\nnumbers on the black market. At one time, he ran the world’s largest credit \\ncard black market, CardersMarket. Now, Max is serving a 13-year prison term Bash Scripting    87while at the same time assisting the Computer Emergency Response Team \\n(CERT) in Pittsburgh with defending against hackers.\\nA few years before Max was caught, he realized that the Aloha Point of \\nSale (POS) system used by many small restaurants had a technical support \\nbackdoor built into it. In this case, the backdoor enabled tech support to \\nassist their clients. Aloha tech support could access the end user’s system \\nthrough port 5505 to provide assistance when the user called for help. Max \\nrealized that if he found a system connected to the internet with the Aloha \\nPOS system, he could access the system with sysadmin privileges through \\nport 5505. Max was able to enter many of these systems and steal tens of \\nthousands of credit card numbers.\\nEventually, Max wanted to find every system that had port 5505 open so \\nthat he could go from stealing thousands of credit card numbers to steal -\\ning millions. Max decided to write a script that would scan millions of IP \\naddresses looking for systems with port 5505 open. Of course, most systems \\ndo not have port 5505 open so, if they did, it was likely they were running the \\ndoomed Aloha POS. He could run this script while at work during the day, \\nthen by night hack into those systems identified as having port 5505 open.\\nOur task is to write a script that will be nearly identical to Max’s script, \\nbut rather than scan for port 5505 as Max did, our script will scan for systems \\nconnected to the ubiquitous online database MySQL. MySQL is an open \\nsource database used behind millions of websites; we’ll be working with \\nMySQL in Chapter 12. By default, MySQL uses port 3306. Databases are the \\n“Golden Fleece” that nearly every black hat hacker is seeking, as they often \\ncontain credit card numbers and personally identifiable information (PII) \\nthat is very valuable on the black market.\\nA Simple Scanner\\nBefore we write the script to scan public IPs across the internet, let’s take on \\nmuch a smaller task. Instead of scanning the globe, let’s first write a script to \\nscan for port 3306 on a local area network to see whether our script actually \\nworks. If it does, we can easily edit it to do the much larger task.\\nIn your text editor, enter the script shown in Listing 8-3.\\nu #! /bin/bash\\nv # This script is designed to find hosts with MySQL installed\\nnmap w-sT 192.168.181.0/24 x-p 3306 y>/dev/null z-oG MySQLscan\\n{ cat MySQLscan | grep open > MySQLscan2 |\\ncat MySQLscan2\\nListing 8-3: The simplified scanner script\\nWe start with the shebang and the interpreter to use u. Let’s follow this \\nwith a comment to explain what the script does v.88   Chapter 8Now let’s use the nmap command to request a TCP scan w on our LAN, \\nlooking for port 3306 x. (Note that your IP addresses may differ; in your \\nterminal, use the ifconfig  command on Linux or the ipconfig  command on \\nWindows to determine your IP address.) The redirect symbol > tells the \\nstandard nmap output, which usually goes to the screen, to instead go to \\n/dev/null , which is simply a place to send output so that it disappears y. \\nWe’re doing this on a local machine, so it doesn’t matter so much, but if you \\nwere to use the script remotely, you’d want to hide the nmap output. We then \\nsend the output of the scan to a file named MySQLscan  in a grep-able format \\nz, meaning a format that grep can work on.\\nThe next line displays the MySQLscan  file we stored the output in and \\nthen pipes that output to grep to filter for lines that include the keyword \\nopen {. Then we put those lines into a file named MySQLscan2  |.\\nFinally, you display the contents of the file MySQLscan2 . This final file \\nshould only include lines of output from nmap with hosts that have port 3306 \\nopen. Save this file as MySQLscanner.sh  and give yourself execute permissions \\nwith chmod 755 . \\nExecute the script, like so:\\nkali >./MySQLscanner.sh\\nHost: 192.168.181.69 () Ports: 3306/open/tcp//mysql///\\nAs we can see, this script was able to identify the only IP address on my \\nLAN with MySQL running. Your results may differ, depending on whether \\nany ports are running MySQL installations on your local network, of course.\\nImproving the MySQL Scanner\\nNow we want to adapt this script to make it applicable to more than just \\nyour own local network. This script would be much easier to use if it could \\nprompt the user for the range of IP addresses they wanted to scan and the \\nport to look for, and then use that input. Remember, you learned how to \\nprompt the user and put their keyboard input into a variable in “Adding \\nFunctionality with Variables and User Input” on page 84 .\\nLet’s take a look at how you could use variables to make this script more \\nflexible and efficient.\\nAdding Prompts and Variables to Our Hacker Script\\nIn your text editor, enter the script shown in Listing 8-4.\\n#! /bin/bash\\nu echo \"Enter the starting IP address : \"\\nv read FirstIP\\nw echo \"Enter the last octet of the last IP address : \"\\nread LastOctetIPBash Scripting    89x echo \"Enter the port number you want to scan for : \"\\nread port\\ny nmap -sT $FirstIP-$LastOctetIP -p $port >/dev/null -oG MySQLscan\\nz cat MySQLscan | grep open > MySQLscan2\\n{ cat MySQLscan2\\nListing 8-4: Your advanced MySQL port scanner\\nThe first thing we need to do is replace the specified subnet with an IP \\naddress range. We’ll create a variable called FirstIP  and a second variable \\nnamed LastOctetIP  to create the range as well as a variable named port for the \\nport number (the last octet is the last group of digits after the third period in \\nthe IP address. In the IP address 192.168.1.101, the last octet is 101).\\nNOTE  The name of the variable is irrelevant, but best practice is to use a variable name that \\nhelps you remember what the variable holds.\\nWe also need to prompt the user for these values. We can do this by \\nusing the echo command that we used in Listing 8-1. \\nTo get a value for the FirstIP  variable, echo \"Enter the starting IP  \\naddress : \"  to the screen, asking the user for the first IP address they want \\nto scan u. Upon seeing this prompt on the screen, the user will enter the \\nfirst IP address, so we need to capture that input from the user. \\nWe can do this with the read command followed by the name of the \\nvariable we want to store the input in v. This command will put the IP \\naddress entered by the user into the variable FirstIP . Then we can use that \\nvalue in FirstIP  throughout our script. \\nWe’ll do the same for the LastOctetIP  w and port x variables by prompt -\\ning the user to enter the information and then using a read command to \\ncapture it.\\nNext, we need to edit the nmap command in our script to use the vari -\\nables we just created and filled. To use the value stored in the variable, \\nwe simply preface the variable name with $, as in $port , for example. So \\nat y, we scan a range of IP addresses, starting with the first user-input IP \\nthrough the second user-input IP, and look for the particular port input \\nby the user. We’ve used the variables in place of the subnet to scan and the \\nport to determine what to scan for. As before, we send the standard output \\nto /dev/null . Then, we send the output in a grep-able format to a file we \\nnamed MySQLscan .\\nThe next line remains the same as in our simple scanner: it outputs the \\ncontents of the MySQLscan  file, pipes it to grep, where it is filtered for lines \\nthat include the keyword open, and then sends that output to a new file named \\nMySQLscan2  z. Finally, we display the contents of the MySQLscan2  file {.\\nIf everything works as expected, this script will scan IP addresses from \\nthe first input address to the last input address, searching for the input port 90   Chapter 8\\nand then reporting back with just the IP addresses that have the designated \\nport open. Save your script file as MySQLscannerAdvanced , remembering to \\ngive yourself execute permission.\\nA Sample Run\\nNow we can run our simple scanner script with the variables that determine \\nwhat IP address range and port to scan without having to edit the script \\nevery time we want to run a scan:\\nkali >./MySQLscannerAdvanced.sh\\nEnter the starting IP address :\\n192.168.181.0\\nEnter the last octet of the last address :\\n255\\nEnter the port number you want to scan for :\\n3306\\nHost: 192.168.181.254 () Ports:3306/open/tcp//mysql//\\nThe script prompts the user for the first IP address, the last octet of the \\nlast IP address, and then the port to scan for. After collecting this info, the \\nscript performs the nmap scan and produces a report of all the IP addresses \\nin the range that have the specified port open. As you can see, even the \\nsimplest of scripting can create a powerful tool. You’ll learn even more \\nabout scripting in Chapter 17.\\nCommon Built-in Bash Commands\\nAs promised, Table 8-1 gives you a list of some useful commands built \\ninto bash.\\nTable 8-1: Built-in Bash Commands\\nCommand Function\\n: Returns 0 or true\\n.

It \\nenables you to automate tasks that would normally take hours of your time, \\nand once the script is saved, it can be used over and over again. Bash script -\\ning is the most basic form of scripting, and you will advance to Python \\nscripting with even more capabilities in Chapter 17.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 9, try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. Create your own greeting script similar to our HelloHackersArise  script.\\n2. Create a script similar to MySQLscanner.sh  but design it to find systems with \\nMicrosoft’s SQL Server database at port 1433. Call it MSSQLscanner .\\n3. Alter that MSSQLscanner  script to prompt the user for a starting and end -\\ning IP address and the port to search for. Then filter out all the IP  addresses \\nwhere those ports are closed and display only those that are open.9\\nCOMPRESSING AND ARCHIVING\\nHackers often need to download and \\ninstall new software, as well as send and \\ndownload multiple scripts and large files. \\nThese tasks are easier if these files are com -\\npressed and combined into a single file. If you come \\nfrom the Windows world, you will probably recognize \\nthis concept from the .zip format, which combines and compresses files to \\nmake them smaller for transferring over the internet or removable media. \\nThere are many ways to do this in Linux, and we look at a few of the most \\ncommon tools for doing so in this chapter. We also look at the dd command, \\nwhich allows you to copy entire drives, including deleted  files on those drives.\\nWhat Is Compression?\\nThe interesting subject of compression could fill an entire book by itself, \\nbut for this book we only need a rudimentary understanding of the process. \\nCompression , as the name implies, makes data smaller, thereby requiring less 94   Chapter 9storage capacity and making the data easier to transmit. For your purposes \\nas a beginning hacker, it will suffice to categorize compression as either \\nlossy or lossless.\\nLossy  compression is very effective in reducing the size of files, but the \\nintegrity of the information is lost. In other words, the file after compres -\\nsion is not exactly the same as the original. This type of compression works \\ngreat for graphics, video, and audio files, where a small difference in the \\nfile is hardly noticeable— .mp3, .mp4 , and .jpg are all lossy compression algo -\\nrithms. If a pixel in a .jpg file or a single note in an .mp3 file is changed, your \\neye or ear is unlikely to notice the difference—though, of course, music \\naficionados will say that they can definitely tell the difference between an \\n.mp3 and an uncompressed .flac file. The strengths of lossy compression are \\nits efficiency and effectiveness. The compression ratio is very high, meaning \\nthat the resulting file is significantly smaller than the original.\\nHowever, lossy compression is unacceptable when you’re sending files \\nor software and data integrity is crucial. For example, if you are sending a \\nscript or document, the integrity of the original file must be retained when \\nit is decompressed. This chapter focuses on this lossless  type of compression, \\nwhich is available from a number of utilities and algorithms. Unfortunately, \\nlossless compression is not as efficient as lossy compression, as you might \\nimagine, but for the hacker, integrity is often far more important than com -\\npression ratio.\\nTarring Files Together\\nUsually, the first thing you do when compressing files is to combine them into \\nan archive. In most cases, when archiving files, you’ll use the tar command. \\nTar stands for tape archive , a reference to the prehistoric days of computing \\nwhen systems used tape to store data. The tar command creates a single file \\nfrom many files, which is then referred to as an archive , tar file , or tarball .\\nFor instance, say you had three script files like the ones we used in \\nChapter 8, named hackersarise1 , hackersarise2 , and hackersarise3 . If you navi -\\ngate to the directory that holds them and perform a long listing, you can \\nclearly see the files and the details you’d expect, including the size of the \\nfiles, as shown here:\\nkali >ls -l\\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root       22311  Nov 27  2018 13:00 hackersarise1.sh\\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root        8791  Nov 27  2018 13:00 hackersarise2.sh\\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root        3992  Nov 27  2018 13:00 hackersarise3.sh\\nLet’s say you want to send all three of these files to another hacker you’re \\nworking with on a project. You can combine them and  create a single archive \\nfile using the command in Listing 9-1.\\nkali >tar -cvf HackersArise.tar hackersarise1 hackersarise2 hackersarise3\\nhackersarise1Compressing and Archiving    95hackersarise2\\nhackersarise3\\nListing 9-1: Creating a tarball of three files\\nLet’s break down this command to better understand it. The archiving \\ncommand is tar, and we’re using it here with three options. The c option \\nmeans create, v (which stands for verbose and is optional) lists the files that \\ntar is dealing with, and f means write to the following file. This last option \\nwill also work for reading from files. Then we give the new archive the file -\\nname you want to create from the three scripts: HackersArise.tar .\\nIn full, this command will take all three files and create a single file, \\nHackersArise.tar , out of them. When you do another long listing of the direc -\\ntory, you will see that it also contains the new .tar file, as shown next:\\nkali >ls -l\\n--snip--\\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  40960 Nov 27 2018 13:32 HackersArise.tar\\n--snip--\\nkali >\\nNote the size of the tarball here: 40,960 bytes. When the three files are \\narchived, tar uses significant overhead to perform this operation: whereas the \\nsum of the three files before archiving was 35,094 bytes, after archiving, the \\ntarball had grown to 40,960 bytes. In other words, the archiv  ing process has \\nadded over 5,000 bytes. Although this overhead can be significant with small \\nfiles, it becomes less and less significant with larger and larger files.\\nWe can display  those files from the tarball, without extracting them, by \\nusing the tar command with the -t content list switch, as shown next:\\nkali >tar -tvf HackersArise.tar\\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root       22311  Nov 27  2018 13:00 hackersarise1.sh\\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root        8791  Nov 27  2018 13:00 hackersarise2.sh\\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root        3992  Nov 27  2018 13:00 hackersarise3.sh\\nHere, we see our three original files and their original sizes. You can \\nthen extract  those files from the tarball using the tar command with the -x \\n(extract) switch, as shown next:\\nkali >tar -xvf HackersArise.tar\\nhackersarise1.sh\\nhackersarise2.sh\\nhackersarise3.sh\\nBecause you’re still using the –v switch, this command will show which \\nfiles are being extracted in the output. If you want to extract the files \\nand do so “silently,” meaning without showing any output, you can simply \\nremove the -v (verbose) switch, as shown here:\\nkali >tar -xf HackersArise.tar96   Chapter 9The files have been extracted into the current directory; you can do \\na long listing on the directory to double-check. Note that by default, if an \\nextracted file already exists, tar will remove the existing file and replace it \\nwith the extracted file.\\nCompressing Files\\nNow we have one archived file, but that file is bigger than the sum of the \\noriginal files. What if you want to compress those files for ease of transport? \\nLinux has several commands capable of creating compressed files. We will \\nlook at these:\\n•\\tgzip, which uses the extension .tar.gz  or .tgz\\n•\\tbzip2 , which uses the extension .tar.bz2\\n•\\tcompress , which uses the extension .tar.z\\nThese all are capable of compressing our files, but they use different \\ncompression algorithms and have different compression ratios. Therefore, \\nwe’ll look at each one and what it’s capable of.\\nIn general, compress  is the fastest, but the resultant files are larger; bzip2  \\nis the slowest, but the resultant files are the smallest; and gzip falls some -\\nwhere in between. The main reason you, as a budding hacker, should know \\nall three methods is that when accessing other tools, you will run into vari -\\nous types of compression. Therefore, this section shows you how to deal \\nwith the main methods of compression.\\nCompressing with gzip\\nLet’s try gzip (GNU zip) first, as it is the most commonly used compression \\nutility in Linux. You can compress your HackersArise.tar  file by entering the \\nfollowing (making sure you’re in the directory that holds the archived file):\\nkali >gzip HackersArise.*\\nNotice that we used the wildcard * for the file extension; this tells Linux \\nthat the command should apply to any file that begins with HackersArise  with \\nany file extension. You will use similar notation for the following examples. \\nWhen we do a long listing on the directory, we can see that HackersArise.tar   \\nhas been replaced by HackersArise.tar.gz , and the file size has been com -\\npressed to just 3,299 bytes!\\nkali >ls -l\\n--snip--\\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3299 Nov 27 2018 13:32 HackersArise.tar.gz\\n--snip--\\nWe can then decompress that same file by using the gunzip  command, \\nshort for GNU unzip .Compressing and Archiving    97kali >gunzip HackersArise.*\\nOnce uncompressed, the file is no longer saved with the .tar.gz  exten -\\nsion but with the .tar extension instead. Also, notice that it has returned to \\nits original size of 40,960 bytes. Try doing a long list to confirm this. \\nCompressing with bzip2\\nAnother of the other widely used compression utilities in Linux is bzip2 , \\nwhich works similarly to gzip but has better compression ratios, mean -\\ning that the resulting file will be even smaller. You can compress your \\nHackersArise.tar  file by entering the following:\\nkali >bzip2 HackersArise.*\\nWhen you do a long listing, you can see that bzip2  has compressed the \\nfile down to just 2,081 bytes! Also note that the file extension is now .tar.bz2 .\\nTo uncompress the compressed file, use bunzip2 , like so:\\nkali >bunzip2 HackersArise.*\\nkali >\\nWhen you do, the file returns to its original size, and its file extension \\nreturns to .tar.\\nCompressing with compress\\nFinally, you can use the command compress  to compress the file. This is \\nprobably the least commonly used compression utility, but it’s easy to \\nremember. To use it, simply enter the command compress  followed by the \\nfilename, like so:\\nkali >compress HackersArise.*\\nkali >ls -l\\n--snip--\\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  5476 Nov 27 2018 13:32 HackersArise.tar.Z\\nNote that the compress  utility reduced the size of the file to 5,476 bytes, \\nmore than twice the size of bzip2 . Also note that the file extension now is \\n.tar.Z  (with an uppercase Z).\\nTo decompress the same file, use uncompress :\\nkali >uncompress HackersArise.*\\nYou can also use the gunzip  command with files that have been com -\\npressed with compress .98   Chapter 9Creating Bit-by-Bit or Physical Copies of Storage Devices\\nWithin the world of information security and hacking, one Linux archiving \\ncommand stands above the rest in its usefulness. The dd command makes \\na bit-by-bit copy of a file, a filesystem, or even an entire hard drive. This \\nmeans that even deleted files are copied (yes, it’s important to know that \\nyour deleted files may be recoverable), making for easy discovery and \\nrecovery. Deleted files will not be copied with most logical copying utili -\\nties, such as cp.\\nOnce a hacker has owned a target system, the dd command will allow \\nthem to copy the entire hard drive or a storage device to their system. In \\naddition, those people whose job it is to catch hackers—namely, forensic \\ninvestigators—will likely use this command to make a physical copy of the \\nhard drive with deleted files and other artifacts that might be useful for \\nfinding evidence against the hacker.\\nIt’s critical to note that the dd command should not be used for typical \\nday-to-day copying of files and storage devices because it is very slow; other \\ncommands do the job faster and more efficiently. It is, though, excellent \\nwhen you need a copy of a storage device without the filesystem or other \\nlogical structures, such as in a forensic investigation.\\nThe basic syntax for the dd command is as follows:\\ndd if=inputfile  of=outputfile\\nSo, if you wanted to make a physical copy of your flash drive, assuming \\nthe flash drive is sdb (we’ll discuss this designation more in Chapter 10), \\nyou would enter the following:\\nkali >dd if=/dev/sdb of=/root/flashcopy\\n1257441=0 records in\\n1257440+0 records out\\n7643809280 bytes (7.6 GB) copied, 1220.729 s, 5.2 MB/s\\nLet’s break down this command: dd is your physical “copy” command; \\nif designates your input file, with /dev/sdb  representing your flash drive in \\nthe /dev directory; of designates your output file; and /root/flashcopy  is the \\nname of the file you want to copy the physical copy to. (For a more com -\\nplete explanation of the Linux system designation of drives within the /dev \\ndirectory, see Chapter 10.)\\nNumerous options are available to use with the dd command, and you \\ncan do a bit of research on these, but among the most useful are the noerror  \\noption and the bs (block size) option. As the name implies, the noerror  option \\ncontinues to copy even if errors are encountered. The bs option allows you \\nto determine the block size (the number of bytes read/written per block) of \\nthe data being copied. By default, it is set to 512 bytes, but it can be changed \\nto speed up the process. Typically, this would be set to the sector size of the Compressing and Archiving    99device, most often 4KB (4,096 bytes). With these options, your command \\nwould look like this:\\nkali >dd if=/dev/media of=/root/flashcopy bs=4096 conv:noerror\\nAs mentioned, it’s worth doing a little more research on your own, but \\nthis is a good introduction to the command and its common usages.\\nSummary\\nLinux has a number of commands to enable you to combine and compress \\nyour files for easier transfer. For combining files, tar is the command of \\nchoice, and you have at least three utilities for compressing files— gzip, bzip2 , \\nand compress —all with different compression ratios. The dd command goes \\nabove and beyond. It enables you to make a physical copy of storage devices \\nwithout the logical structures such as a filesystem, allowing you to recover \\nsuch artifacts as deleted files.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 10, try out the skills you learned from this \\nchapter by completing the following exercises:\\n1. Create three scripts to combine, similar to what we did in Chapter 8. \\nName them Linux4Hackers1 , Linux4Hackers2 , and Linux4Hackers3 .\\n2. Create a tarball from these three files. Name the tarball L4H. Note how the \\nsize of the sum of the three files changes when they are tarred together.\\n3. Compress the L4H tarball with gzip. Note how the size of the file changes. \\nInvestigate how you can control overwriting existing files. Now uncompress \\nthe L4H file. \\n4. Repeat Exercise 3 using both bzip2 and compress .\\n5. Make a physical, bit-by-bit copy of one of your flash drives using the dd \\ncommand.10\\nFILESYSTEM AND STORAGE  \\nDEVICE MANAGEMENT\\nIf you are coming from a Windows envi -\\nronment, the way that Linux represents \\nand manages storage devices will look \\nrather different to you. You’ve already seen \\nthat the filesystem has no physical representation of \\nthe drive, like the C:, D:, or E: system in Windows, \\nbut rather has a file tree structure with / at the top, \\nor root, of it. This chapter takes a look at how Linux \\nrepresents storage devices such as hard drives, flash \\ndrives, and other storage devices.\\nWe first look how additional drives and other storage devices are \\nmounted upon that filesystem, leading up to the / (root) directory. \\nMounting  in this context simply means attaching drives or disks to the \\n filesystem to make them accessible to the operating system (OS). For you \\nas a hacker, it’s necessary to understand the file and storage device manage -\\nment system, both on your own system and, often, the system of your target. 102   Chapter 10Hackers commonly use external media to load data, hacking tools, or even \\ntheir OS. Once you’re on your target system, you need to understand what \\nyou’re working with, where to find confidential or other critical files, how to \\nmount a drive to the target, and whether and where you can put those files \\non your system. We cover all of these topics, plus how to manage and moni -\\ntor storage devices, in this chapter.\\nWe begin with the directory known as /dev, which you’ve probably \\nalready noticed in the directory structure: dev is short for device , and every \\ndevice in Linux is represented by its own file within the /dev directory. Let’s \\nstart out by working with /dev.\\nThe Device Directory /dev\\nLinux has a special directory that contains files representing each attached \\ndevice: the appropriately named /dev directory. As your first introduction, \\nnavigate to the /dev directory and then perform a long listing on it. You \\nshould see something like Listing 10-1.\\nkali >cd /dev\\nkali >ls -l\\ntotal 0\\ncrw-------   1  root root  10, 175  May 16  12:44 agpgart\\ncrw-------   1  root root  10, 235  May 16  12:44 autofs\\ndrwxr-xr-x   1  root root      160  May 16  12:44 block\\n--snip--\\nlrwxrwxrwx   1  root root        3  May 16  12:44 cdrom -> sr0\\n--snip--\\ndrwxr-xr-x   2  root root       60  May 16  12:44 cpu\\n--snip--\\nListing 10-1: A long listing of the /dev directory\\nThe devices are displayed in alphabetical order by default. You may \\n recognize some of the devices, such a cdrom and cpu, but others have \\nrather cryptic names. Each device on your system is represented by a file \\nin the /dev directory, including devices you’ve probably never used or even \\nrealized existed. On the off chance you do, there is a device file waiting to \\nbe used for it.\\nIf you scroll down this screen a bit, you should see more listings of \\ndevices. Of particular interest are the devices sda1, sda2, sda3, sdb, and \\nsdb1, which are usually the hard drive and its partitions and a USB flash \\ndrive and its partitions.\\n--snip--\\nbrw-rw----  1  root root        8,     0    May 16 12:44   sda\\nbrw-rw----  1  root root        8,     1    May 16 12:44   sda1\\nbrw-rw----  1  root root        8,     2    May 16 12:44   sda2\\nbrw-rw----  1  root root        8,     5    May 16 12:44   sda5Filesystem and Storage Device Management    103brw-rw----  1  root root        8,     16   May 16 12:44   sdb\\nbrw-rw----  1  root root        8,     17   May 16 12:44   sdb1\\n--snip--\\nLet’s take a closer look at these.\\nHow Linux Represents Storage Devices\\nLinux uses logical labels for drives that are then mounted on the filesystem. \\nThese logical labels will vary depending on where the drives are mounted, \\nmeaning the same hard drive might have different labels at different times, \\ndepending on where and when it’s mounted.\\nOriginally, Linux represented floppy drives (remember those?) as fd0 \\nand hard drives as hda. You will still occasionally see these drive repre -\\nsentations on legacy Linux systems, but today most floppy drives are gone \\n(thank goodness). Even so, old legacy hard drives that used an IDE or \\nE-IDE inte  rface are still represented in the form hda. Newer Serial ATA \\n(SATA) interface drives and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) hard \\ndrives are represented as sda. Drives are sometimes split up into sections \\nknown as partitions , which are represented in the labeling system with num -\\nbers, as you’ll see next.\\nWhen systems have more than one hard drive, Linux simply names \\nthem serially by incrementing the last letter in alphabetical order, so the \\nfirst drive is sda, and the second drive is sdb, the third drive is sdc, and so \\non (see Table 10-1). The serial letter after sd is often referred to as the major  \\nnumber.\\nTable 10-1: Device-Naming System\\nDevice file Description\\nsda First SATA hard drive\\nsdb Second SATA hard drive\\nsdc Third SATA hard drive\\nsdd Fourth SATA hard drive\\nDrive Partitions\\nSome drives can be split into partitions in order to manage and separate \\ninformation. For instance, you may want to separate your hard drive so \\nthat your swap  file, home  directory, and / directory are all on separate \\n partitions—you might want to do this for a number of reasons, including \\nto share resources and to relax the default permissions. Linux labels each \\npartition with a minor number  that comes after the drive designation. This \\nway, the first partition on the first SATA drive would be sda1. The second \\npartition would then be sda2, the third sda3, and so on, as illustrated in \\nTable 10-2.104   Chapter 10Table 10-2: Partition-Labeling System\\nPartition Description\\nsda1 The first partition (1) on the first (a) SATA drive\\nsda2 The second (2) partition on the first (a) drive\\nsda3 The third (3) partition on the first (a) drive\\nsda4 The fourth (4) partition on the first (a) drive\\nAt times, you may want to view the partitions on your Linux system to \\nsee which ones you have and how much capacity is available in each. You \\ncan do this by using the fdisk  utility. Using the -l switch with fdisk  lists all \\nthe partitions of all the drives, as shown in Listing 10-2.\\nkali >fdisk -l\\nDisk /dev/sda:  20GiB,  21474836480 bytes,  41943040  sectors\\nUnits:  sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\\nDisk label type: dos\\nDisk identifier: 0x7c06cd70\\nDevice     Boot     Start       End   Sectors    Size  Id Type\\n/dev/sda1    *       2048  39174143  39172096   18.7G  83 Linux\\n/dev/sda2        39176190  41940991   2764802    1.3G   5 Extended\\n/dev/sda5        39176192  41940991   2764800    1.3G  82 Linux swap / Solaris\\nDisk /dev/sdb: 29.8 GiB, 31999393792 bytes, 62498816 sectors\\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\\nDisk label type: dos\\nDisk identifier: 0xc3072e18\\nDevice     Boot  Start       End   Sectors   Size  Id  Type\\n/dev/sdb1           32  62498815  62498784  29.8G   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\\nListing 10-2: Listing partitions with fdisk\\nAs you can see in Listing 10-2, the devices sda1, sda2, and sda5 are \\nlisted in the first stanza. These three devices make up the virtual disk from \\nmy virtual machine, which is a 20GB drive with three partitions, including \\nthe swap partition (sda5), which acts like virtual RAM—similar to page \\nfiles in Windows—when RAM capacity is exceeded.\\nIf you scan down Listing 10-2 to the third stanza, you see a second \\ndevice output designated sdb1—the b label tells us that this drive is sepa -\\nrate from the first three devices. This is my 64GB flash drive. Note that \\nfdisk  indicates that it is an HPFS/NTFS/ExFAT filesystem type. These file \\ntypes—High Performance File System (HPFS), New Technology File System \\n(NTFS), and Extended File Allocation Table (exFAT)—are not native to \\nLinux systems but rather to macOS and Windows systems. It’s worth being Filesystem and Storage Device Management    105able to recognize file types native to different systems when you investigate. \\nThe filesystem might indicate what kind of machine the drive was format -\\nted on, which can be valuable information. Kali is able to utilize USB flash \\ndrives created on many different operating systems.\\nAs you saw in Chapter 1, the Linux filesystem is structured significantly \\ndifferently than are Windows and other proprietary operating systems. On \\ntop of this, the way files are stored and managed is different in Linux, too. \\nNew versions of Windows use an NTFS filesystem, whereas older Windows \\nsystems use File Allocation Table (FAT) systems. Linux uses a number of \\ndifferent types of filesystems, but the most common are ext2, ext3, and \\next4. These are all iterations of the ext (or extended ) filesystem, with ext4 \\nbeing the latest.\\nCharacter and Block Devices\\nSomething else to note about the naming of device files in the /dev direc -\\ntory is that the first position contains either c or b. You can see this in List -\\ning 10-1 at the start of most of the entries, and it looks something like this:\\ncrw-------   1  root root  10, 175  May 16  12:44 agpgart\\nThese letters represent the two ways that devices transfer data in and \\nout. The c stands for character, and these devices are known, as you might \\nexpect, as character  devices. External devices that interact with the system \\nby sending and receiving data character by character, such as mice or key -\\nboards, are character devices.\\nThe b stands for the second type: block devices. They communicate in \\nblocks of data (multiple bytes at a time) and include devices like hard drives \\nand DVD drives. These devices require higher-speed data throughput and \\ntherefore send and receive data in blocks (many characters or bytes at a \\ntime). Once you know whether a device is a character or block device, you \\ncan easily get more information about it, as you’ll see next.\\nList Block Devices and Information with lsblk\\nThe Linux command lsblk , short for list block , lists some basic information \\nabout each block device listed in /dev. The result is similar to the output \\nfrom fdisk -l , but it will also display devices with multiple partitions in a \\nkind of tree, showing each device with its partitions as branches, and does \\nnot require root privileges to run. In Listing 10-3, for example, we see sda, \\nwith its branches sda1, sda2, and sda5.\\nkali >lsblk\\nName      MAJ:MIN  RM  SIZE  RO  TYPE  MOUNTPOINT\\nfd0         2:0     1    4K   0  disk\\nsda1        8:0     0   20G   0  disk\\n|-sda1      8:1     0 18.7G   0  part  /\\n|-sda2      8:2     0    1K   0  part\\n|-sda5      8:5     0  1.3G   0  part  [SWAP]106   Chapter 10sdb         8:16    1 29.8G   0  disk\\n|-sdb1      8.17    1 29.8G   0  disk  /media\\nsr0         11:0    1  2.7G   0  rom\\nListing 10-3: Listing block device information with lsblk\\nThe output may include the floppy drive as fd0 and DVD drive as sr0, \\neven though neither is on my system—this is simply a holdover from legacy \\nsystems. We can also see information on the mount point  of the drive—this is \\nthe position at which the drive was attached to the filesystem. Note that the \\nhard drive sda1 is mounted at / and the flash drive is mounted at /media . \\nYou’ll see more on the significance of this in the next section.\\nMounting and Unmounting\\nMost modern operating systems, including most new versions of Linux, \\nautomount  storage devices when they’re attached, meaning the new flash \\ndrive or hard drive is automatically attached to the filesystem. For those \\nnew to Linux, mounting might be a foreign subject.\\nA storage device must be first physically  connected to the filesystem and \\nthen logically  attached to the filesystem in order for the data to be made \\navailable to the operating system. In other words, even if the device is physi -\\ncally attached to the system, it is not necessarily logically attached and avail -\\nable to the operating system. The term mount  is a legacy from the early days \\nof computing when storage tapes (before hard drives) had to be physically \\nmounted to the computer system—think of those big computers with spin -\\nning tape drives you might have seen old sci-fi movies.\\nAs mentioned, the point in the directory tree where devices are attached \\nis known as the mount point . The two main mount points in Linux are /mnt  \\nand /media . As a convention, devices such as external USB devices and flash \\ndrives can be manually mounted at /mnt , but when automatically mounted, \\nthe /media  directory is used (though technically any directory can be used).\\nMounting Storage Devices Yourself\\nIn some versions of Linux, you need to mount a drive manually in order to \\naccess its content, so this is a skill worth learning. To mount a drive on the \\nfilesystem, use the mount  command. The mount point for the device should \\nbe an empty directory; if you mount a device on a directory that has subdi -\\nrectories and files, the mounted device will cover  the contents of the direc -\\ntory, making them invisible and unavailable. So, to mount the new hard \\ndrive sdb1 at the /mnt  directory, you would enter the following:\\nkali >mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\\nThat hard drive should then be available for access. If you want to \\nmount the flash drive sdc1 at the /media  directory, you would enter this:\\nkali >mount /dev/sdc1 /mediaFilesystem and Storage Device Management    107The filesystems on a system that are mounted at boot-time are kept in a \\nfile at /etc/fstab  (short for filesystem table ), which is read by the system at every \\nbootup.\\nUnmounting with umount\\nIf you’re coming from a Mac or Windows background, you’ve probably \\nunmounted a drive without knowing it. Before you remove a flash drive \\nfrom your system, you “eject” it to keep from causing damage to the files \\nstored on the device. Eject is just another word for unmount.\\nSimilar to the mount  command, you can unmount a second hard drive \\nby entering the umount  command followed by the file entry of the device in \\nthe /dev directory, such as /dev/sdb . Note that the command is not spelled \\nunmount  but rather umount  (no n).\\nkali >umount /dev/sdb1\\nYou cannot unmount a device that is busy, so if the system is reading or \\nwriting to the device, you will just receive an error.\\nMonitoring Filesystems\\nIn this section, we look at some commands for monitoring the state of the \\nfilesystem—a skill necessary for any hacker or system administrator. We’ll get \\nsome info about mounted disks and then check for and fix errors. Storage \\ndevices are particularly error prone, so it’s worth learning this skill.\\nGetting Information on Mounted Disks\\nThe command df (for disk free ) will provide us with basic information on \\nany hard disks or mounted devices, such as CD, DVD, and flash drives, \\nincluding how much space is being used and how much is available (see \\nListing 10-4). Without any options, df defaults to all mounted drives. If \\nyou want to check a different drive, simply follow the df command with \\nthe drive representation you want to check (for example, df sdb ).\\nkali >df\\nFilesystem          1K-Blocks      Used  Available Use%     Mounted on\\nrootfs               19620732  17096196    1504788  92%     /\\nudev                    10240         0      10240   0%     /dev\\n--snip--\\n/dev/sdb1            29823024  29712544     110480  99%     /media/USB3.0\\nListing 10-4: Getting information on disks and mounted devices with df\\nThe first line of output here shows category headers, and then we get \\nthe information. The disk space is given in 1KB blocks. On the second \\nline, we see that rootfs  has 19,620,732 one-kilobyte blocks, of which it is 108   Chapter 10using 17,096,196 (or about 92 percent), leaving 1,504,788 available. The \\ndf command also tells us that this filesystem is mounted on the top of the \\nfilesystem /.\\nIn the last line, you can see my USB flash drive. Note that it is designated \\n/dev/sdb1 , is nearly 100 percent full, and is mounted at /media/USB3.0 .\\nAs a recap, my virtual disk on this system is designated sda1, which \\nbreaks down as follows:\\nsd SATA hard drive\\na First hard drive\\n1 First partition on that drive\\nMy 64GB flash drive is designated as sdb1, and my external drive as sdc1.\\nChecking for Errors\\nThe fsck command (short for filesystem check ) checks the filesystem for errors \\nand repairs the damage, if possible, or else puts the bad area into a bad blocks  \\ntable to mark it as bad. To run the fsck command, you need to specify the \\ndevice file to check. It’s important to note that you must unmount the drive \\nbefore running a filesystem check. If you fail to unmount the mounted \\ndevice, you will receive the error message shown in Listing 10-5.\\nkali >fsck\\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\\ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)\\n/dev/sda1 is mounted\\ne2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.\\nListing 10-5: Trying (and failing) to run an error check on a mounted drive\\nSo, the first step when performing a filesystem check is to unmount the \\ndevice. In this case, I will unmount my flash drive to do a filesystem check:\\nkali >umount /dev/sdb1\\nI can add the -p option to have fsck automatically repair any problems \\nwith the device, like so:\\nkali >fsck -p /dev/sdb1\\nWith the device unmounted, I can now check for any bad sectors or \\nother problems with the device, as follows:\\nkali >fsck -p /dev/sdb1\\nfsck from util-linux 2.30.2\\nexfatfsck 1.2.7\\nChecking file system on /dev/sdb1.\\nFile system version           1.0\\nSector size                 512 bytesFilesystem and Storage Device Management    109Cluster size                 32 KB\\nVolume size                7648 MB\\nUsed space                 1265 MB\\nAvailable space            6383 MB\\nTotally 20 directories and 111 files.\\nFile system checking finished. No errors found.\\nSummary\\nUnderstanding how Linux designates and manages its devices is crucial \\nfor any Linux user and hacker. Hackers will need to know what devices \\nare attached to a system and how much space is available. Because storage \\ndevices often develop errors, we can check and repair those errors with \\nfsck. The dd command is capable of making a physical copy of a device, \\nincluding any deleted files.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 11, try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. Use the mount  and umount  commands to mount and unmount your flash \\ndrive.\\n2. Check the amount of disk space free on your primary hard drive.\\n3.

Use the lsblk  command to determine basic characteristics of your block \\ndevices.11\\nTHE LOGGING SYSTEM\\nFor any Linux user, it’s crucial to be know\\xad\\nledgeable in the use of the log files. Log \\nfiles store information about events that \\noccur when the operating system and applica \\xad\\ntions are run, including any errors and security alerts. \\nYour system will log information automatically based \\non the series of rules that I will show you how to con \\xad\\nfigure in this chapter.\\nAs a hacker, the log files can be a trail to your target’s activities and \\nidentity. But it can also be a trail to your own activities on someone else’s \\nsystem. A hacker therefore needs to know what information they can gather, \\nas well as what can be gathered about their own actions and methods in \\norder to hide that evidence.\\nOn the other side, anyone securing Linux systems needs to know how \\nto manage the logging functions to determine whether a system has been \\nattacked and then decipher what actually happened and who did it.112   Ch a p t e r 11This chapter shows you how to examine and configure log files, as well \\nas how to remove evidence of your activity and even disable logging alto \\xad\\ngether. First, we’ll look at the daemon that does the logging.\\nThe rsyslog Logging Daemon\\nLinux uses a daemon called syslogd  to automatically log events on your com \\xad\\nputer. Several variations of syslog , including rsyslog  and syslog-ng , are used \\non different distributions of Linux, and even though they operate very simi \\xad\\nlarly, some minor differences exist. Since Kali Linux is built on Debian, and \\nDebian comes with rsyslog  by default, we focus on that utility in this chap \\xad\\nter. If you want to use other distributions, it’s worth doing a little research \\non their logging systems.\\nLet’s take a look at rsyslog  on your system. We’ll search for all files \\nrelated to rsyslog . First, open a terminal in Kali and enter the following:\\nkali >locate rsyslog\\n/etc/rsyslog.conf\\n/etc/rsyslog.d\\n/etc/default/rsyslog\\n/etc/init.d/rsyslog\\n/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server/rsyslog\\n/etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog\\n/etc/rc0.d/K04rsyslog\\n--snip--\\nAs you can see, numerous files contain the keyword rsyslog —some of \\nwhich are more useful than others. The one we want to examine is the con \\xad\\nfiguration file rsyslog.conf .\\nThe rsyslog Configuration File\\nLike nearly every application in Linux, rsyslog  is managed and configured \\nby a plaintext configuration file located, as is generally the case in Linux, in \\nthe /etc directory. In the case of rsyslog , the configuration file is located at  \\n/etc/rsyslog.conf . Open that file with any text editor, and we’ll explore what’s \\ninside (here, I use Leafpad):\\nkali >leafpad /etc/rsyslog.conf\\nYou should see something like Listing 11 \\xad1.\\n#/etc/rsyslog.conf Configuration file for rsyslog.\\n# For more information see\\n# /usr/share/doc/rsyslog-doc/html/rsyslog_conf.html\\n#################\\n#### MODULES ####\\n#################The Logging System    113module(load=\"imuxsock\") # provides support for local system logging\\nmodule(load=\"imklog\") # provides kernel logging support\\n#module(load=\"immark\") # provides --MARK-- message capability\\n# provides UDP syslog reception\\n#module(load=\"imudp\")\\n#input(type=\"imudp\" port=\"514\")\\n# provides TCP syslog reception\\n#module(load=\"imtcp\")\\n#input(type=\"imtcp\" port=\"514\")\\n###########################\\n#### GLOBAL DIRECTIVES ####\\n###########################\\n--snip--\\nListing 11-1: A snapshot of the rsyslog.conf  file\\nAs you can see, the rsyslog.conf  file comes well documented with numer \\xad\\nous comments explaining its use. Much of this information will not be use \\xad\\nful to you at this moment, but if you navigate down to below line 55, you’ll \\nfind the Rules  section. This is where you can set the rules for what your \\nLinux system will automatically log for you.\\nThe rsyslog Logging Rules\\nThe rsyslog  rules determine what kind of information is logged, what pro \\xad\\ngrams have their messages logged, and where that log is stored. As a hacker, \\nthis allows you to find out what is being logged and where those logs are \\nwritten so you can delete or obscure them. Scroll to about line 55 and you \\nshould see something like Listing 11 \\xad2.\\n###############\\n#### RULES ####\\n###############\\n#\\n# First some standard log files. Log by facility.\\n#\\nauth,authpriv.*             /var/log/auth.log\\n*.*;auth,authpriv.none      -/var/log/syslog\\n#cron.*                     /var/log/cron.log\\ndaemon.*                    -/var/log/daemon.log\\nkern.*                      -/var/log/kern.log\\n1pr.*                       -/var/log/lpr.log\\nmail.*                      -/var/log/mail.log\\nuser.*                      -/var/log/user.log\\n#\\n# Logging for the mail system. Split it up so that\\n# it is easy to write scripts to parse these files.\\n#114   Ch a p t e r 11mail.info                   -/var/log/mail.info\\nmail.warn                   -/var/log/mail.warn\\nmail.err                    /var/log/mail.err\\nListing 11-2: Finding the logging rules in rsyslog.conf\\nEach line is a separate logging rule that says what messages are logged \\nand where they’re logged to. The basic format for these rules is as follows:\\nfacility .priority            action\\nThe facility  keyword references the program, such as mail, kernel , or \\nlpr, whose messages are being logged. The priority  keyword determines \\nwhat kind of messages to log for that program. The action  keyword, on \\nthe far right, references the location where the log will be sent. Let’s look \\nat each section more closely, beginning with the facility  keyword, which \\nrefers to whatever software is generating the log, whether that’s the kernel, \\nthe mail system, or the user.\\nThe following is a list of valid codes that can be used in place of the \\nfacility  keyword in our configuration file rules:\\nauth, authpriv  Security/authorization messages\\ncron Clock daemons\\ndaemon  Other daemons\\nkern Kernel messages\\nlpr Printing system\\nmail Mail system\\nuser Generic user \\xadlevel messages\\nAn asterisk wildcard ( *) in place of a word refers to all facilities. You \\ncan select more than one facility by listing them separated by a comma.\\nThe priority  tells the system what kinds of messages to log. Codes are \\nlisted from lowest priority, starting at debug , to highest priority, ending at \\npanic . If the priority is *, messages of all priorities are logged. When you spec \\xad\\nify a priority, messages of that priority and higher are logged. For instance, if \\nyou specify a priority code of alert , the system will log messages classified \\nas alert  and higher priority, but it won’t log messages marked as crit or any \\npriority lower than alert .\\nHere’s the full list of valid codes for priority :\\n•\\tdebug\\n•\\tinfo\\n•\\tnotice\\n•\\twarning\\n•\\twarn\\n•\\terror\\n•\\terrThe Logging System    115•\\tcrit\\n•\\talert\\n•\\temerg\\n•\\tpanic\\nThe codes warn, error , and panic  have all been deprecated and should \\nnot be used.\\nThe action  is usually a filename and location where the logs should be \\nsent. Note that generally, log files are sent to the /var/log  directory with a \\nfilename that describes the facility that generated them, such as auth. This \\nmeans, for example, that logs generated by the auth facility would be sent to \\n/var/log.auth.log .\\nLet’s look at some examples of log rules:\\nmail.* /var/log/mail\\nThis example will log mail events of all ( *) priorities to /var/log/mail .\\nkern.crit /var/log/kernel\\nThis example will log kernel events of critical ( crit) priority or higher \\nto /var/log/kernel .\\n*.emerg :omusmsg:*\\nThis last example will log all events of the emergency ( emerg ) priority to \\nall logged \\xadon users. With these rules, the hacker can determine where the \\nlog files are located, change the priorities, or even disable specific logging \\nrules.\\nAutomatically Cleaning Up Logs with logrotate\\nLog files take up space, so if you don’t delete them periodically, they will \\neventually fill your entire hard drive. On the other hand, if you delete your \\nlog files too frequently, you won’t have logs to investigate at some future \\npoint in time. You can use logrotate  to determine the balance between \\nthese opposing requirements by rotating your logs.\\nLog rotation  is the process of regularly archiving log files by moving them \\nto some other location, leaving you with a fresh log file. That archived loca \\xad\\ntion will then get cleaned up after a specified period of time.\\nYour system is already rotating log files using a cron job that employs the \\nlogrotate  utility. You can configure the logrotate  utility to choose the regu \\xad\\nlarity of your log rotation with the /etc/logrotate.conf  text file. Let’s open it \\nwith a text editor and take a look:\\nkali >leafpad /etc/logrotate.conf116   Ch a p t e r 11You should see something like Listing 11 \\xad3.\\n# see \"man logrotate\" for details\\n# rotate log files weekly\\nu weekly\\n# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs\\nv rotate 4\\nw # create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones\\ncreate\\nx # uncomment this if you want your log files compressed\\n#compress\\n# packages drop log rotation information into this directory\\ninclude /etc/logrotate.d\\n# system-specific logs may also be configured here\\n--snip--\\nListing 11-3: The logrotate  configuration file\\nFirst, you can set the unit of time your rotate numbers refer to u. The \\ndefault here is weekly , meaning any number after the rotate  keyword always \\nrefers to weeks.\\nFurther down, you can see the setting for how often to rotate logs—the \\ndefault setting is to rotate logs every four weeks v. This default configura \\xad\\ntion will work for most people, but if you want to keep your logs longer for \\ninvestigative purposes or shorter to clear them out quicker, this is the set \\xad\\nting you should change. For instance, if you check your log files every week \\nand want to save storage space, you could change this setting to rotate 1 . If \\nyou have plenty of storage for your logs and want to keep a semi \\xadpermanent \\nrecord for forensic analysis later, you could change this setting to rotate 26  \\nto keep your logs for six months or rotate 52  to keep them for one year.\\nBy default, a new empty log file is created when old ones are rotated \\nout w. As the comments in the configuration file advise, you can also \\nchoose to compress your rotated log files x. \\nAt the end of each rotation period, the log files are renamed and pushed \\ntoward the end of the chain of logs as a new log file is created, replacing the \\ncurrent log file. For instance, /var/log.auth  will become /var/log.auth.1 , then \\n/var/log.auth.2 , and so on. If you rotate logs every four weeks and keep four \\nset of backups, you will have /var/log.auth.4 , but no /var/log.auth.5 , meaning \\nthat /var/log.auth.4  will be deleted rather than being pushed to /var/log/\\nauth.5 . You can see this by using the locate  command to find /var/log/  \\nauth.log  log files with a wildcard, as shown here:\\nkali >ls /var/log/auth.log*\\n/var/log/auth.log.1The Logging System    117/var/log/auth.log.2\\n/var/log/auth.log.3\\n/var/log/auth.log.4\\nFor more details on the many ways to customize and use the logrotate  \\nutility, see the man logrotate  page. This is an excellent resource to learn \\nabout the functions you can use and the variables you can change to cus \\xad\\ntomize how your logs are handled. Once you become more familiar with \\nLinux, you’ll get a better sense of how often you need to log and what \\noptions you prefer, so it’s worth revisiting the logrotate.conf  file.\\nRemaining Stealthy\\nOnce you’ve compromised a Linux system, it’s useful to disable logging and \\nremove any evidence of your intrusion in the log files to reduce the chances \\nof detection. There are many ways to do this, and each carries its own risks \\nand level of reliability.\\nRemoving Evidence\\nFirst, you’ll want to remove any logs of your activity. You could simply open \\nthe log files and precisely remove any logs detailing your activity, line by \\nline, using the file deletion techniques you learned in Chapter 2. However, \\nthis could be time \\xadconsuming and leave time gaps in the log files, which \\nwould look suspicious. Also, deleted files can generally be recovered by a \\nskilled forensic investigator.\\nA better and more secure solution is to shred the log files. With other \\nfile deletion systems, a skilled investigator is still able to recover the deleted \\nfiles (deleted files are simply made available to be overwritten by the file\\xad\\nsystem; they still exist until they are overwritten), but suppose there was a \\nway to delete the file and overwrite it several times, making it much harder \\nto recover. Lucky for us, Linux has a built \\xadin command, appropriately \\nnamed shred , for just this purpose.\\nTo understand how the shred  command works, take a quick look at the \\nhelp screen by entering the following command:\\nkali >shred --help\\nUsage: shred [OPTION]...FILE...\\nOverwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly in order to make it harder\\nfor even very expensive hardware probing to recover data\\n--snip--\\nAs you can see from the full output on your screen, the shred  command \\nhas many options. In its most basic form, the syntax is simple:\\nshred <FILE>118   Ch a p t e r 11On its own, shred  will delete the file and overwrite it several times—  \\nby default, shred  overwrites four times. Generally, the more times the file is \\noverwritten, the harder it is to recover, but keep in mind that each overwrite \\ntakes time, so for very large files, shredding may become time \\xadconsuming.\\nTwo useful options to include are the -f option, which changes the per \\xad\\nmissions on the files to allow overwriting if a permission change is neces \\xad\\nsary, and the –n option, which lets you choose how many times to overwrite \\nthe files. As an example, we’ll shred the log files in /var/log/auth.log  10 times \\nusing the following command:\\nkali >shred -f -n 10 /var/log/auth.log.*\\nWe need the –f option to give us permission to shred auth files, and we \\nfollow the –n option with the desired number of times to overwrite. After \\nthe path of the file we want to shred, we include the wildcard asterisk so \\nwe’re shredding not just the auth.log  file, but also any logs that have been \\ncreated with logrotate , such as auth.log.1 , auth.log.2 , and so on.\\nNow try to open a log file:\\nkali >leafpad /var/log/auth.log.1\\nOnce you’ve shredded a file, you’ll see that the contents are indecipher \\xad\\nable gibberish, as shown in Figure 11 \\xad1.\\nFigure 11-1: A shredded log file\\nNow if the security engineer or forensic investigator examines the log \\nfiles, they will find nothing of use because none of it is recoverable!\\nDisabling Logging\\nAnother option for covering your tracks is to simply disable logging. When \\na hacker takes control of a system, they could immediately disable logging \\nto prevent the system from keeping track of their activities. This, of course, \\nrequires root privileges.\\nTo disable all logging, the hacker could simply stop the rsyslog  daemon. \\nStopping any service in Linux uses the same syntax, shown here (you’ll see \\nmore on this in Chapter 12):\\nservice servicename  start|stop|restartThe Logging System    119So, to stop the logging daemon, you could simply enter the following \\ncommand:\\nkali >service rsyslog stop\\nNow Linux will stop generating any log files until the service is \\nrestarted, enabling you to operate without leaving behind any evidence \\nin the log files!\\nSummary\\nLog files track nearly everything that happens on your Linux system. They \\ncan be an invaluable resource in trying to analyze what has occurred, \\nwhether it be a malfunction or a hack. For the hacker, log files can be evi \\xad\\ndence of their activities and identity. However, an astute hacker can remove \\nand shred these files and disable logging entirely, thus leaving no evidence \\nbehind.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 12, try out the skills you learned from this chapter \\nby completing the following exercises:\\n1. Use the locate  command to find all the rsyslog  files.\\n2. Open the rsyslog.conf  file and change your log rotation to one week.\\n3. Disable logging on your system. Investigate what is logged in the file  \\n/var/log/syslog  when you disable logging.\\n4. Use the shred  command to shred and delete all your kern log files.12\\nUSING AND ABUSING SERVICES\\nIn Linux terminology, a service  is an appli -\\ncation that runs in the background wait -\\ning for you to use it. Your Linux system has \\ndozens of services preinstalled. Of these, the \\nmost well known is the ubiquitous Apache Web Server, \\nwhich is used for creating, managing, and deploying \\nweb servers, but there are so many more. For the pur -\\nposes of this chapter on services, I have selected just \\nfour that are of particular importance to the hacker: \\nApache Web Server, OpenSSH, MySQL/MariaDB, \\nand PostgreSQL.\\nIn this chapter, you’ll learn how to set up a web server with Apache, \\nphysically spy with OpenSSH, access data with MySQL/MariaDB, and store \\nyour hacking information with PostgreSQL122   Chapter 12Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Services\\nBefore we begin to work with these four crucial services, let’s start by exam -\\nining how to start, stop, and restart services in Linux.\\nSome services can be stopped and started via the GUI in Kali Linux, \\nmuch as you would on an operating system like Windows or Mac. However, \\nsome services require use of the command line, which we’ll look at here. \\nHere is the basic syntax for managing services:\\nservice servicename  start|stop|restart\\nTo start the apache2 service (web server or HTTP service), you would \\nenter the following:\\nkali >service apache2 start\\nTo stop the Apache web server, enter:\\nkali >service apache2 stop\\nUsually, when you make a configuration change to an application \\nor service by altering its plaintext configuration file, you need to restart \\nthe service to capture  the new configuration. Thus, you would enter the \\nfollowing:\\nkali >service apache2 restart\\nNow that you understand how to start, stop, and restart services from \\nthe command line, let’s move on to the four most critical Linux services to \\nhackers.\\nCreating an HTTP Web Server with the Apache Web Server\\nThe Apache Web Server is probably the most commonly used service on \\nLinux systems. Apache is found on over 55 percent of the world’s web serv -\\ners, so any self-respecting Linux admin should be familiar with it. As a \\nhacker aspiring to hack websites, it’s critical to understand the inner work -\\nings of Apache, websites, and the backend databases of these sites. You can \\nalso use Apache to set up your own web server, from which you could serve \\nup malware via cross-site scripting (XSS) to anyone who visits your site, or \\nyou could clone a website and redirect traffic to your site via abuse of the \\nDomain Name System (DNS). In either of these cases, a basic knowledge of \\nApache is required.Using and Abusing Services    123Starting with Apache\\nIf you have Kali running on your system, Apache is already installed. Many \\nother Linux distros have it installed by default as well. If you don’t have \\nApache installed, you can download and install it from the repositories by \\nentering the following:\\nkali >apt-get install apache2\\nThe Apache Web Server is often associated with the MySQL database \\n(which we will look at in the next section) and these two services are very \\noften paired with a scripting language such as Python or PHP to develop \\nweb applications. This combination of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP \\nor Python forms a powerful and robust platform for the development and \\ndeployment of web-based applications, known collectively as LAMP . These \\nare the most widely used tools for developing websites in the Linux world—\\nand they’re very popular in the Microsoft world too, where they’re generally \\nreferred to as WAMP , with the W standing for Windows.\\nFrom the command line enter the following:\\nkali >service apache2 start\\nNow that Apache is running in the background, it should be able to \\nserve up its default web page. Enter http://localhost/  in your favorite web \\nbrowser to bring up the web page, which should look something like \\nFigure  12-1.\\nFigure 12-1: The Apache2 Web Server default page\\nAs you can see, Apache displays “It works” as its default web page. Now \\nthat you know your Apache Web Server is working, let’s customize it!124   Chapter 12Editing the index.html File\\nApache’s default web page is at /var/www/html/index.html . You can edit the \\nindex.html  file to serve up whatever information you want, so let’s create our \\nown. For this, you can use any text editor you please; I’ll be using Leafpad. \\nOpen up /var/www/html/index.html  and you should see something like \\nListing 12-1.\\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\"\\n\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtm11/DTD/xhtm11-transitional.dtd\">\\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>\\n    <head>\\n        <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" I>\\n    u <title>Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works</title>\\n        <style type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\">\\n    * {\\n        margin: Opx Opx Opx Opx;\\n        padding: Opx Opx Opx Opx;\\n    }\\nbody, html {\\n    padding: 3px 3px 3px 3px;\\n    background-color: #D8DBE2;\\n    font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\\n    font-size: 11pt;\\n    text-align: center;\\n}\\ndiv.main_page {\\n    position: relative;\\n    display: table;\\n--snip--\\nListing 12-1: The Apache Web Server index.html  file\\nNote here that the default web page has exactly the text that was dis -\\nplayed when we opened our browser to localhost, but in HTML format u. \\nAll we need to do is edit or replace this file to have our web server display \\nthe information we want.\\nAdding Some HTML\\nNow that we have the web server up and running and the index.html  file \\nopen, we can add whatever text we’d like the web server to serve up. We \\nwill create some simple HTML blocks.\\nLet’s create this page. In a new file in your text editor, enter the code \\nshown in Listing 12-2.\\n<html>\\n<body>\\n<h1>Hackers-Arise Is the Best! </h1>Using and Abusing Services    125<p> If you want to learn hacking, Hackers-Arise.com </p>\\n<p> is the best place to learn hacking!</p>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\nListing 12-2: Some simple HTML to add to the index.html  file\\nOnce you have entered the text exactly as it appears in Listing 12-2, \\nsave this file as /var/www/html/index.html  and close your text editor. Your \\ntext editor will then prompt you that the file already exists. That’s okay. Just \\noverwrite the existing /var/www/html/index.html  file.\\nSeeing What Happens\\nHaving saved our /var/www/html/index.html  file, we can check to see what \\nApache will serve up. Navigate your browser once again to http://localhost , \\nand you should see something like Figure 12-2.\\nFigure 12-2: New Hackers-Arise website\\nApache has served up our web page just as we created it!\\nOpenSSH and the Raspberry Spy Pi\\nSSH is an acronym for Secure Shell  and is basically what enables us to connect \\nsecurely to a terminal on a remote system—a replacement for the insecure \\ntelnet  that was so common decades ago. When we’re building a web server, \\nSSH enables us to create an  access list  (a list of users who can use this service), \\nauthenticate users with encrypted passwords, and encrypt all communica -\\ntion. This reduces the chance of unwanted users using the remote terminal \\n(due to the added authentication process) or intercepting our communica -\\ntion (due to encryption). Probably the most widely used Linux SSH service \\nis OpenSSH, which is installed on nearly every Linux distribution, includ -\\ning Kali.\\nSystem administrators often use SSH to manage remote systems, and \\nhackers often use SSH to connect to compromised remote systems, so we’ll \\ndo the same here. In this example, we use SSH to set up a remote Raspberry \\nPi system for spying, something I call the “Raspberry Spy Pi.” For this, you’ll \\nneed a Raspberry Pi and the attendant Raspberry Pi camera module.126   Chapter 12Before we do that, though, start OpenSSH on your Kali system with the \\nnow familiar command:\\nkali >service ssh start\\nWe’ll be using SSH to build and control a remote spying Raspberry Pi. \\nIf you’re not already familiar with it, the Raspberry Pi is a tiny but powerful, \\ncredit card–sized computer that works great as a remote spying tool. We \\nwill employ a Raspberry Pi with a camera module to use as a remote spying \\ndevice. You can purchase a Raspberry Pi at nearly any electronics retailer, \\nincluding Amazon, for less than $50, and you can get the camera module \\nfor about $15. \\nHere, we’ll use the Raspberry Spy Pi on the same network as our Kali \\nsystem, which allows us to use private, internal IP addresses. Of course, \\nwhen hacking in the real world, you’d probably want to set it up on another \\nremote network, but that would be a touch more difficult and beyond the \\nscope of this book.\\nSetting Up the Raspberry Pi\\nMake certain that your Raspberry Pi is running the Raspbian operating \\nsystem; this is simply another Linux distribution specifically ported for \\nthe Raspberry Pi CPU. You can find download and installation instruc -\\ntions for Raspbian at https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ . Nearly \\neverything you’ve learned in this book applies to the Raspbian OS on the \\nRaspberry Pi as well as Kali, Ubuntu, and other Linux distributions.\\nOnce you have your Raspbian OS downloaded and installed, you’ll \\nneed to connect your Raspberry Pi to a monitor, mouse, and keyboard \\nand then connect it to the internet. If this is all new to you, check out the \\ninstructions at https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/hardware-guide/ . With \\neverything set up, log in with the username pi and the password raspberry .\\nBuilding the Raspberry Spy Pi\\nThe first step is to make certain that SSH is running and enabled on the \\nRaspberry Spy Pi. SSH is usually off by default, so to enable it, go to the \\nPreferences menu and launch Raspberry Pi Configuration . Then go to the \\nInterfaces  tab and, next to SSH, click Enabled  (if it is not already checked) \\nand click OK.\\nWhen SSH is enabled, you can start it on your Raspberry Spy Pi by \\nopening a terminal and entering the following:\\n$ pi >service ssh start\\nNext you need to attach your camera module. If you’re using a Raspberry \\nPi version 3 board, there’s only one place to connect it. Switch the Pi off, Using and Abusing Services    127attach the module to the camera port, and then switch it on again. Note that \\nthe camera is very fragile and must never come into contact with the general-\\npurpose input/output (GPIO) pins; otherwise, it might short and die.\\nNow, with the SSH service up and running, place the Raspberry Spy \\nPi somewhere within your home, school, or some other location you want \\nto spy on. It must, of course, be connected to the local area network, \\neither by Ethernet cable or, ideally, via Wi-Fi. (The new Raspberry Pi 3 and \\nRaspberry Pi Zero  both have built-in Wi-Fi.)\\nNow, you need to obtain the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. As you \\nlearned in Chapter 3, you can get a Linux device’s IP address by using \\nifconfig :\\npi >ifconfig\\nThe IP address of my Pi is 192.168.1.101, but make certain you are using \\nthe IP address of your Raspberry Spy Pi wherever my address appears in this \\nchapter. Now, from your Kali system, you should be able to connect directly \\nto and control your Raspberry Spy Pi and use it as a remote spying system. \\nIn this simple example, your system will need to be on the same network as \\nthe Pi.\\nTo connect to the remote Raspberry Spy Pi via SSH from your Kali \\nsystem, enter the following, remembering to use your own Pi’s IP address:\\nkali >ssh pi@192.168.1.101\\npi@192.168.1.101\\'s password:\\nThe programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;\\nthe exact distribution terms for each program are described in the\\nindividual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.\\nDebian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, the extent\\npermitted by applicable law\\nlast login: Tues Jan. 1 12:01:01 2018\\npi@raspberyypi:: $\\nThe Spy Pi will then prompt you for a password.

Feel free to explore this versatile weapon further.130   Chapter 12\\nExtracting Information from MySQL/MariaDB\\nMySQL is the most widely used database behind database-driven web \\napplications. In our modern era of Web 2.0 technologies, where nearly \\nevery website is database driven, this means MySQL/MariaDB holds the \\ndata for most of the web.\\nDatabases are the “golden fleece” for hackers. They contain critical \\ninformation about users as well as confidential information such as credit \\ncard numbers. For this reason, hackers are most often targeting databases.\\nLike Linux, MySQL and MariaDB are open source and general public \\nlicensed (GPL), and you’ll find at least one of them preinstalled on nearly \\nevery Linux distribution.\\nBeing free, open source, and powerful, MySQL and MariaDB have \\nbecome the databases of choice for many web applications, including \\npopular websites such as WordPress, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Kayak, \\nWalmart.com, Wikipedia, and YouTube.\\nOther popular content management systems (CMSs) such as Joomla, \\nDrupal, and Ruby on Rails all use MySQL, too. You get the idea. If you want \\nto develop or attack the backend databases of web applications, you should \\nknow a little SQL. In the following sections, I’ll assume you’re working from \\nMySQL, though the commands will work for either MariaDB or MySQL; \\nthe output will just be a little different. Let’s get started.\\nPAST AND FUTURE OF MYSQL\\nMySQL was first developed by MySQL AB of Sweden in 1995 and then was \\npurchased by Sun Microsystems in 2008, which in turn was purchased by \\nOracle in 2009—so MySQL is now owned by Oracle. Oracle is the world’s \\nlargest database software publisher, so the open source community has \\nsignificant trepidations about Oracle’s commitment to keeping MySQL open \\nsource. As a result, there is now a fork of the MySQL database software called \\n“Maria” that is committed to keeping this software and its subsequent versions \\nopen source. As a Linux admin or hacker, you should keep an eye on Maria.\\nStarting MySQL or MariaDB\\nFortunately, Kali has either MySQL or MariaDB already installed (if you’re \\nusing another distribution, you can download and install MySQL from the \\nsoftware repository or directly from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/ ).\\nTo start your MySQL or MariaDB service, enter the following into the \\nterminal:\\nkali >service mysql startUsing and Abusing Services    131Next, you need to authenticate yourself by logging in. Enter the follow -\\ning and, when prompted for a password, just press enter :\\nkali >mysql -u root -p\\nEnter password:\\nWelcome to MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \\\\g.\\nYour MySQL connection id is 4\\nServer version: 5.6.30-1 (Debian)\\nCopyright (c) 2000, 2016, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved\\nType \\'help;\\' or \\'\\\\h\\' for help. Type \\'\\\\c\\' to clear the current input statement\\nmysql >\\nIn the default configuration of MySQL or MariaDB, the root user’s \\npassword is empty. Obviously, this is a major security vulnerability, and you \\nshould  remedy this by adding a password after your first login. Note that \\nusernames and passwords for your operating system and MySQL are sepa -\\nrate and distinct. Let’s change the password for the MySQL root user now \\nin order to be safe.\\nInteracting with SQL\\nSQL is an interpreted programming language for interfacing with a data -\\nbase. The database is often a relational  database, meaning data is stored \\nin multiple tables that interact and each table has values in one or more \\ncolumns and rows.\\nThere are several implementations of SQL, each with its own commands \\nand syntax, but here are a few common commands:\\nselect  Used to retrieve data\\nunion  Used to combine the results of two or more select operations\\ninsert  Used to add new data\\nupdate  Used to modify existing data\\ndelete  Used to delete data\\nYou can supply conditions to each command in order to be more spe -\\ncific about what you want to do. For example, the line\\nselect user, password from customers where user=\\'admin\\';\\nwill return the values for the user and password fields for any user whose \\nuser value is equal to “admin” in the customers table.\\nSetting a Password\\nLet’s see what users are already in our MySQL system by entering the \\nfollowing. (Note that commands in MySQL are terminated with a \\nsemicolon.)132   Chapter 12mysql >select user, host, password from mysql.user;\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n| user                   | host                       | password\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n|root                    |localhost                   |\\n--snip--\\nThis shows that the root users have no password set. Let’s assign a \\npassword to root. To do so we’ll first select a database to work with. MySQL \\non your system will come with some databases already set up. Use the \\nshow databases;  command to see all the available databases:\\nmysql >show databases;\\n+-------------------------------+\\n| Database                      |\\n+-------------------------------+\\n| information_schema            |\\n| mysql                         |\\n| performance_schema            |\\n+-------------------------------+\\n3 rows in set (0.23 sec)\\nMySQL comes with three databases by default, two of which ( information_  \\nschema  and performance_schema ) are administrative databases that we won’t use \\nhere. We’ll use the non-administrative database, mysql , which is included for \\nyour own purposes. To begin using the mysql  database, enter:\\nmysql >use mysql;\\nReading table information for completion of table and column names\\nYou can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A\\nDatabase changed\\nThis command connects us to mysql . Now, we can set the password for \\nthe root user to hackers-arise  with the following command:\\nmysql >update user set password = PASSWORD(\"hackers-arise\") where user = \\'root\\';\\nThis command will update the user by setting the user’s root password \\nto hackers-arise .\\nAccessing a Remote Database\\nTo access a MySQL database on the localhost, we use the following syntax:\\nkali >mysql -u <username> -pUsing and Abusing Services    133This command defaults to using the MySQL instance on the localhost \\nif it isn’t given a hostname or IP address. To access a remote database, then, \\nwe need to provide the hostname or IP address of the system that is hosting \\nthe MySQL database. Here’s an example:\\nkali >mysql -u root -p 192.168.1.101\\nThis will connect us to the MySQL instance at 192.168.1.101 and prompt \\nus for a password. For demonstration purposes, I am connecting to a MySQL \\ninstance on my local area network (LAN). If you have a system on your \\nnetwork with MySQL installed, use its IP address here. I will assume you’ve \\nmanaged to bypass the password and have logged in to system as root (you \\nalready know that by default, the mysql  database has no password).\\nThis opens up the MySQL command line interface, which provides us \\nwith the mysql >  prompt. As well as this command line interface, MySQL has \\nGUI interfaces—both native (MySQL Workbench) and third party (Navicat \\nand TOAD for MySQL). For you as a hacker, the command line interface \\nmay be the best opportunity for exploiting the MySQL database, so we’ll \\nfocus on that here. It’s unlikely that as an unauthorized entrant to the data -\\nbase, you will be presented with an easy-to-use GUI.\\nNOTE  Remember that all commands must end in a semicolon or \\\\g (unlike Microsoft’s SQL \\nServer) and that we can get help by entering help;  or \\\\h.\\nNow that we’re logged in as the system admin, we can navigate unim -\\npeded through the database. If we had logged in as a regular user, our \\nnavigation would be limited by the permissions provided by the system \\nadministrator for that user.\\nConnecting to a Database\\nWith access to the system, we want to snoop around. Our next step is to find \\nout whether there are any databases worth accessing. Here is the command \\nto find which databases are on the accessed system:\\nmysql >show databases;\\n+-------------------------------+\\n| Database                      |\\n+-------------------------------+\\n| information schema            |\\n| mysql                         |\\n| creditcardnumbers             |\\n| performance_schema            |\\n+-------------------------------+\\n4 rows in set (0.26 sec)\\nAha! We’ve found a database worth exploring named creditcardnumbers . \\nLet’s connect to it.134   Chapter 12In MySQL, as in other database management systems (DBMS), we can \\nconnect to the database we are interested in by entering use databasename ;.\\nmysql >use creditcardnumbers;\\nDatabase changed\\nThe Database changed  response indicates that we are now connected to \\nthe creditcardnumbers  database.\\nOf course, it should go without saying that it’s unlikely a database \\nadmin would be so accommodating as to name a database something \\nas easily recognizable as creditcardnumbers , so you may need to do a bit of \\nexploring to find a database of interest.\\nDatabase Tables\\nWe are now connected to the creditcardnumbers  database and can do a bit of \\nexploring to see what information it might hold. Data in a database is orga -\\nnized into tables , and each table might hold a different set of related data. \\nWe can find out what tables are in this database by entering the following \\ncommand:\\nmysql >show tables;\\n+-----------------------------------+\\n| Tables_in_creditcardnumbers       |\\n+-----------------------------------+\\n|  cardnumbers                      |\\n+-----------------------------------+\\n1 row in set (0.14 sec)\\nHere, we can see that this database has just one table in it, called \\ncardnumbers . Generally, databases will have numerous tables in them, so it’s \\nlikely you’ll have to do a bit more snooping. In this sample database, we are \\nfortunate to be able to focus our attention on this single table to extract the \\nhacker’s golden fleece!\\nNow that we have a table we want to examine, we need to understand \\nthe structure of that table. Once we know how the table is laid out, we can \\nextract the relevant information.\\nYou can see the structure of the table using the describe  statement, \\nlike so:\\nmysql >describe cardnumbers;\\n+---------------+--------------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+\\n| Field         | Type         | Null    | Key       | Default | Extra   |\\n+---------------+--------------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+\\n| customers     | varchar(15)  | YES     |           | NULL    |         |\\n| address       | varchar(15)  | YES     |           | NULL    |         |\\n| city          | varchar(15)  | YES     |           | NULL    |         |\\n| state         | varchar(15)  | YES     |           | NULL    |         |\\n| cc            | int(12)      | NO      |           | 0       |         |\\n+---------------+--------------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+Using and Abusing Services    135MySQL responds with the critical information on the structure of our \\ntable of interest. We can see the name of each field as well as the data type \\nit holds (often the text type varchar  or integer type int). We can also see \\nwhether it will accept NULL values; the key, if any exists (the key links tables); \\nany default values a field might have; and any extra information at the end, \\nsuch as notes.\\nExamining the Data\\nTo actually see the data in the table, we use the SELECT  command. The SELECT  \\ncommand requires you to know the following information:\\n•\\tThe table that holds the data you want to view\\n•\\tThe columns within that table that hold the data you want to view\\nWe lay this out in the following format:\\nSELECT columns FROM table;\\nAs a handy shortcut to look at data from all the columns, we can use an \\nasterisk as a wildcard instead of typing out every column name we want to \\nlook at. So, to see a dump of all the data from the cardnumbers  table, we enter \\nthe following:\\nmysql >SELECT * FROM cardnumbers;\\n+-----------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------------+\\n| customers | address       | city        | state   | cc           |\\n+-----------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------------+\\n| Jones     |  1 Wall St    | NY          | NY      |   12345678   |\\n| Sawyer    | 12 Piccadilly | London      | UK      |  234567890   |\\n| Doe       | 25 Front St   | Los Angeles | CA      | 4567898877   |\\n+-----------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------------+\\nAs you can see, MySQL has displayed all the information from the \\ncardnumbers  table to our screen. We have found the hacker’s golden fleece!\\nPostgreSQL with Metasploit\\nPostgreSQL, or just Postgres, is another open source relational database \\noften used in very large, internet-facing applications due to its ability to \\nscale easily and handle heavy workloads. It was first released in July 1996 \\nand is maintained by a substantial group of developers known as the \\nPostgreSQL Global Development Group.\\nPostgreSQL is also installed by default in Kali, but if you are using \\nanother Linux distribution, it will likely be in your repository and you can \\ninstall it by entering the following command:\\nkali >apt-get postgres install136   Chapter 12As a hacker, you will find PostgreSQL particularly important because \\nit is the default database of the most widely used penetration testing and \\nhacking framework, Metasploit. Metasploit uses PostgreSQL to store its \\nmodules, as well as the results of scans and exploits, for ease of use in a pen -\\netration test or hack. For that reason, we will be using PostgreSQL here in \\nthe context of Metasploit.\\nAs with nearly all the services in Linux, we can start PostgreSQL by \\nentering service application  start , like so:\\nkali >service postgresql start\\nWith PostgreSQL up and running, let’s start Metasploit:\\nkali >msfconsole\\nNote that when Metasploit has completed starting up, you will see an \\nmsf >  prompt.\\nTeaching you how to use Metasploit for hacking and exploitation pur -\\nposes is beyond the scope of this book, but here we’ll set up the database \\nthat Metasploit will store its information in.\\nWith Metasploit running, we can set up PostgreSQL with the following \\ncommand so that it stores data from any Metasploit activity on your system:\\nmsf >msfdb init\\n[*] exec :msfdb init\\nCreating database use \\'msf\\'\\nEnter password for new role\\nEnter it again:\\nCreating databases \\'msf\\' and \\'msf_test\\'\\nCreating configuration file /usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml\\nCreating initial database schema\\nNext, we need to log in to Postgres as root. Here, we precede the com -\\nmand with su, the “switch user” command, to obtain root privileges:\\nmsf >su postgres\\n[*] su postgres\\npostgres@kali:/root$\\nWhen you log in to Postgres, you will see that the prompt has changed \\nto postgres@kali:/root$ , representing the application, the hostname, and \\nthe user.\\nIn the next step, we need to create a user and password, like so:\\npostgres@kali: /root$ createuser msf_user -P\\nEnter Password for new role:\\nEnter it again:Using and Abusing Services    137We create the username msf_user  using the –P (uppercase P) option with \\nthe createuser  command. Then enter your desired password twice. Next, you \\nneed to create the database and grant permissions for msf_user . Name the \\ndatabase hackers_arise_db , as shown here:\\npostgres@kali: /root$ createdb --owner=msf_user hackers_arise_db\\npostgres@kali: /root$ exit\\nWhen you exit from Postgres with the exit command, the terminal will \\nfall back into the msf >  prompt.\\nNext, we have to connect our Metasploit console, msfconsole, to our \\nPostgreSQL database by defining the following:\\n•\\tThe user\\n•\\tThe password\\n•\\tThe host\\n•\\tThe database name\\nIn our case, we can connect msfconsole to our database with the follow -\\ning command:\\nmsf >db_connect msf_user:password@127.0.0.1/hackers_arise_db\\nYou will, of course, need to provide the password you used earlier. The \\nIP address is that of your local system (localhost), so you can use 127.0.0.1 \\nunless you built this database on a remote system.\\nLastly, we can check the status of the PostgreSQL database to make \\nsure it’s connected:\\nmsf >db_status\\n[*] postgresql connected to msf\\nAs you can see, Metasploit responds that the PostgreSQL database is \\nconnected and ready to use. Now when we do a system scan or run exploits \\nwith Metasploit, the results will be stored in our PostgreSQL database. In \\naddition, Metasploit now stores its modules in our Postgres database, mak -\\ning searches for the right module much easier and faster!\\nSummary\\nLinux has numerous services that run in the background until the user \\nneeds them. The Apache Web Server is the most widely used, but a hacker \\nshould be familiar with MySQL, SSH, and PostgreSQL for various tasks, \\ntoo. In this chapter, we covered the absolute basics of getting started with \\nthese services. Once you’re comfortable with your Linux system, I urge you \\nto go out and explore each of these services further.138   Chapter 12EXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 13, try out the skills you learned from this \\nchapter by completing the following exercises:\\n1. Start your apache2 service through the command line.\\n2. Using the index.html  file, create a simple website announcing your arrival \\ninto the exciting world of hacking.\\n3. Start your SSH service via the command line. Now connect to your Kali \\nsystem from another system on your LAN.\\n4. Start your MySQL database service and change the root user password to \\nhackers-arise . Change to the mysql  database.\\n5. Start your PostgreSQL database service. Set it up as described in this \\nchapter to be used by Metasploit.13\\nBECOMING SECURE AND  \\nANONYMOUS\\nToday, nearly everything we do on the \\ninternet is tracked. Whoever is doing the \\ntracking—whether it be Google tracking our \\nonline searches, website visits, and email or the \\nNational Security Agency (NSA) cataloging all our \\nactivities—our every online move is being recorded,\\nindexed, and then mined for someone’s benefit. The average individual—\\nand the hacker, in particular—needs to understand how to limit this track -\\ning and remain relatively anonymous on the web to limit this ubiquitous \\nsurveillance.\\nIn this chapter, we look at how you can navigate the World Wide Web \\nanonymously (or as close as you can get) using four methods:\\n•\\tThe Onion Network\\n•\\tProxy servers\\n•\\tVirtual private networks\\n•\\tPrivate encrypted email140   Chapter 13No one method is sure to keep your activities safe from prying eyes, and \\ngiven enough time and resources, anything can be tracked. However, these \\nmethods will likely make the tracker’s job much more difficult.\\nHow the Internet Gives Us Away\\nTo begin, let’s discuss at a high level some of the ways our activities on the \\ninternet are tracked. We won’t go into all tracking methods, or into too much \\ndetail about any one method, as that would be beyond the scope of this book. \\nIndeed, such a discussion could take up an entire book on its own.\\nFirst, your IP address identifies you as you traverse the internet. Data \\nsent from your machine is generally tagged with your IP address, making \\nyour activities easy to track. Second, Google and other email services will \\n“read” your email, looking for keywords to more efficiently serve you ads. \\nAlthough there are many more sophisticated methods that are far more \\ntime and resource intensive, these are the ones we try to prevent in this \\nchapter. Let’s start by taking a look at how IP addresses give us away on the \\ninternet.\\nWhen you send a packet of data across the internet, it contains the IP \\naddresses of the source and destination for the data. In this way, the packet \\nknows where it is going and where to return the response. Each packet hops \\nthrough multiple internet routers until it finds its destination and then \\nhops back to the sender. For general internet surfing, each hop is a router \\nthe packet passes through to get to its destination. There can be as many as \\n20–30 hops between the sender and the destination, but usually any packet \\nwill find its way to the destination in fewer than 15 hops.\\nAs the packet traverses the internet, anyone intercepting the packet can \\nsee who sent it, where it has been, and where it’s going. This is one way web -\\nsites can tell who you are when arrive and log you in automatically, and it’s \\nalso how someone can track where you’ve been on the internet.\\nTo see what hops a packet might make between you and the destination, \\nyou can use the traceroute  command, as shown next. Simply enter traceroute  \\nand the destination IP address or domain, and the command will send out \\npackets to the destination and trace the route of those packets.\\nkali >traceroute google.com\\ntraceroute to google.com (172.217.1.78), 30 hops max, 60 bytes packets\\n1   192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)   4.152 ms 3.834 ms 32.964 ms\\n2   10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  5.797 ms 6.995 ms 7.679 ms\\n3   96.120.96.45 (96.120.96.45)  27.952 ms 30.377 ms 32.964 ms\\n--snip--\\n18 lgal15s44-in-f14.le100.net (172.217.1.78)  94.666 ms 42.990 ms 41.564 ms\\nAs you can see, www.google.com  is 18 hops across the internet from me. \\nYour results will likely be different because your request would be com -\\ning from a different location and because Google has many servers across \\nthe globe. In addition, packets don’t always take the same route across the Becoming Secure and Anonymous    141internet, so you might send another packet from your address to the same \\nsite and receive a different route. Let’s see how we can disguise all this with \\nthe Tor network.\\nThe Onion Router System\\nIn the 1990s, the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) set out to develop a \\nmethod for anonymously navigating the internet for espionage purposes. \\nThe plan was to set up a network of routers that was separate from the \\ninternet’s routers, that could encrypt the traffic, and that only stored the \\nunencrypted IP address of the previous  router—meaning all other router \\naddresses along the way were encrypted. The idea was that anyone watching \\nthe traffic could not determine the origin or destination of the data. This \\nresearch became known as “The Onion Router (Tor) Project” in 2002, and \\nit’s now available to anyone to use for relatively safe and anonymous naviga -\\ntion on the web.\\nHow Tor Works\\nPackets sent over Tor are not sent over the regular routers so closely moni -\\ntored by so many but rather are sent over a network of over 7,000 routers \\naround the world, thanks to volunteers who allow their computers to be used \\nby Tor. On top of using a totally separate router network, Tor encrypts the \\ndata, destination, and sender IP address of each packet. At each hop, the \\ninformation is encrypted and then decrypted by the next hop when it’s \\nreceived. In this way, each packet contains information about only the pre -\\nvious hop along the path and not the IP address of the origin. If someone \\nintercepts the traffic, they can see only the IP address of the previous hop, \\nand the website owner can see only the IP address of the last router that \\nsent the traffic (see Figure 13-1). This ensures relative anonymity across \\nthe internet.\\nAnnie+\\n+ +\\nBill+Tor node\\nEncrypted path\\nClear path++\\nFigure 13-1: How Tor uses encrypted traffic data142   Chapter 13To enable the use of Tor, just install the Tor browser from https://www  \\n.torproject.org/ . Once installed, it will look something like Figure 13-2, and \\nyou can use it like any old internet browser. By using this browser, you’ll be \\nnavigating the internet through a separate set of routers and will be able to \\nvisit sites without being tracked by Big Brother. Unfortunately, the tradeoff \\nis that surfing via the Tor browser can be a lot slower; because there are not \\nnearly as many routers, the bandwidth is limited in this network.\\nFigure 13-2: The landing page for the Tor browser\\nIn addition to being capable of accessing nearly any website on the tra -\\nditional internet, the Tor browser is capable of accessing the dark web . The \\nwebsites that make up the dark web require anonymity, so they allow access \\nonly through the Tor browser, and they have addresses ending in .onion  for \\ntheir top-level domain (TLD). The dark web is infamous for illegal activity, \\nbut a number of legitimate services are also available there. A word of cau -\\ntion, however: when accessing the dark web, you may come across material \\nthat many will find offensive.\\nSecurity Concerns\\nThe intelligence and spy services of the United States and other nations \\nconsider the Tor network a threat to national security, believing such an \\nanonymous network enables foreign governments and terrorists to com -\\nmunicate without being watched. As a result, a number of robust, ambi -\\ntious research projects are working to break the anonymity of Tor.\\nTor’s anonymity has been broken before by these authorities and will \\nlikely be broken again. The NSA, as one instance, runs its own Tor routers, \\nmeaning that your traffic may be traversing the NSA’s routers when you use Becoming Secure and Anonymous    143Tor. If your traffic is exiting the NSA’s routers, that’s even worse, because \\nthe exit router always knows your destination. The NSA also has a method \\nknown as traffic correlation , which involves looking for patterns in incoming \\nand outgoing traffic, that has been able to break Tor’s anonymity. Though \\nthese attempts to break Tor won’t affect Tor’s effectiveness at obscuring \\nyour identity from commercial services, such as Google, they may limit the \\nbrowser’s effectiveness in keeping you anonymous from spy agencies.\\nProxy Servers\\nAnother strategy for achieving anonymity on the internet is to use proxies , \\nwhich are intermediate systems that act as middlemen for traffic: the user \\nconnects to a proxy, and the traffic is given the IP address of the proxy \\nbefore it’s passed on (see Figure 13-3). When the traffic returns from \\nthe destination, the proxy sends the traffic back to the source. In this \\nway, traffic appears to come from the proxy and not the originating IP \\naddress.\\nYour IP address\\n65.55.125.1289\\nWeb server Your ISPProxy server Your IP address\\n65.55.125.1289IP proxy server\\n172.23.26.8\\nFigure 13-3: Running traffic through a proxy server\\nOf course, the proxy will likely log your traffic, but an investigator would \\nhave to get a subpoena or search warrant to obtain the logs. To make your \\ntraffic even harder to trace, you can use more than one proxy, in a strategy \\nknown as a proxy chain , which we’ll look at a little later in this chapter.\\nKali Linux has an excellent proxying tool called proxychains  that you \\ncan set up to obscure your traffic. The syntax for the proxychains  command \\nis straightforward, as shown here:\\nkali >proxychains < the command you want proxied > <arguments >\\nThe arguments you provide might include an IP address. For example, \\nif you wanted to use proxychains  to scan a site with nmap anonymously, you \\nwould enter the following:\\nkali >proxychains nmap -sT -Pn < IP address >144   Chapter 13This would send the nmap –sS  stealth scan command to the given IP \\naddress through a proxy. The tool then builds the chain of proxies itself, \\nso you don’t have to worry about it.\\nSetting Proxies in the Config File\\nIn this section, we set a proxy for the proxychains  command to use. As \\nwith nearly every application in Linux/Unix, configuration of proxychains  \\nis managed by the config file—specifically /etc/proxychains.conf . Open \\nthe config file in your text editor of choice with the following command \\n(replacing leafpad  with your chosen editor if necessary):\\nkali >leafpad /etc/proxychains.conf\\nYou should see a file like the one shown in Listing 13-1.\\n# proxychains.conf VER 3.1\\n# HTTP, SOCKS4, SOCKS5 tunneling proxifier with DNS.\\n# The option below identifies how the ProxyList is treated.\\n# only one option should be uncommented at time,\\n# otherwise the last appearing option will be accepted\\n#\\n# dynamic_chain\\n#\\n# Dynamic - Each connection will be done via chained proxies\\n# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list\\n# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain\\n# (dead proxies are skipped)\\n# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app \\n#\\n# strict chain\\n#\\n# Strict - Each connection will be done via chained proxies\\n# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list\\n# all proxies must be online to play in chain\\n# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app\\n--snip--\\nListing 13-1: The proxychains.conf  file\\nScroll down this file to line 61, and you should see the ProxyList  section, \\nas shown in Listing 13-2.\\n[ProxyList]\\n# add proxy here...\\n# meanwhileBecoming Secure and Anonymous    145# defaults set to \"tor\"\\nsocks4 127.0.0.1 9050\\nListing 13-2: The section of the config file for adding proxies\\nWe can add proxies by entering the IP addresses and ports of the proxies \\nwe want to use in this list. For now, we’ll use some free proxies. You can find \\nfree proxies by googling “free proxies” or using the site http://www.hidemyna  \\n.me, as shown in Figure 13-4. Note, however, that using free proxies in real-life \\nhacking activity is not a good idea. I’ll cover this in more detail later in the \\nchapter. The example used here is just for educational purposes.\\nFigure 13-4: Free proxies from http://www.hidemy.name\\nFill in the details in the form or just click search ; then add one of the \\nresulting proxies to your proxychains.conf  file using the following format:\\nType IPaddress  Port\\nHere’s an example:\\n [ProxyList]\\n# add proxy here...\\nsocks4 114.134.186.12 22020\\n# meanwhile\\n# defaults set to \"tor\"\\n# socks4 127.0.0.1 9050146   Chapter 13It’s important to note that proxychains  defaults to using Tor if you \\ndon’t enter any proxies of your own. The last line in Listing 13-2 directs \\nproxychains  to send traffic first through the host at 127.0.0.1 on port 9050 \\n(the default Tor configuration). If you’re not adding your own proxies and \\nwant to use Tor, leave this as it is. If you are not using Tor, you’ll need to \\ncomment out this line (add a # before it).\\nAs much as I like Tor, as mentioned, it is usually very slow. Also, because \\nthe NSA has broken Tor, I am much less likely to depend on it for anonym -\\nity. I therefore comment out this line and add my own set of proxies.\\nLet’s test it out. In this example, I am going to open the browser Firefox \\nand have it navigate to https://www.hackers-arise.com/  anonymously by send -\\ning the traffic through a proxy.\\nThe command is as follows:\\nkali >proxychains firefox www.hackers-arise.com\\nThis successfully opens https://www.hackers-arise.com/  in Firefox through \\nmy chosen proxy and returns the results to me. To anyone tracing this traffic, \\nit appears that it was my proxy that navigated to https://www.hackers-arise.com/  \\nrather than my IP address.\\nSome More Interesting Options\\nNow that we have proxychains  working, let’s look at some other options we \\ncan configure through the proxychains.conf  file. As we now have it set up, we \\nare simply using a single proxy. However, we can put in multiple proxies and \\nuse all of them, we can use a limited number from the list, or we can have \\nproxychains  change the order randomly. Let’s try all these options.\\nAdding More Proxies\\nFirst, let’s add some more proxies to our list. Go back to http://www.hidemy  \\n.name  and find some more proxy IP addresses. Then add a few more of \\nthese proxies to your proxychains.conf  file, like so:\\n[ProxyList]\\n# add proxy here...\\nsocks4 114.134.186.12 22020\\nsocks4 188.187.190.59 8888\\nsocks4 181.113.121.158 335551\\nNow save this config file and try running the following command:\\nkali >proxychains firefox www.hackers-arise.com\\nYou won’t notice any difference, but your packet is now traveling \\nthrough several proxies.Becoming Secure and Anonymous    147Dynamic Chaining\\nWith multiple IPs in our proxychain.conf  file, we can set up dynamic chaining , \\nwhich runs our traffic through every proxy on our list and, if one of the \\nproxies is down or not responding, automatically goes to the next proxy in \\nthe list without throwing an error. If we didn’t set this up, a single failing \\nproxy would break our request.\\nGo back into your proxychains  configuration file, find the dynamic_chain  \\nline (line 10), and uncomment it, as shown next. Also make sure you com -\\nment out the strict_chain  line if it isn’t already.\\n# dynamic_chain\\n#\\n# Dynamic – Each connection will be done via chained proxies\\n# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list\\n# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain\\n--snip--\\nThis will enable dynamic chaining of our proxies, thus allowing for \\ngreater anonymity and trouble-free hacking. Save the config file and feel \\nfree to try it out.\\nRandom Chaining\\nOur final proxy trick is the random chaining  option, where proxychains  will \\nrandomly choose a set of IP addresses from our list and use them to create \\nour proxy chain. This means that each time we use proxychains , the proxy \\nwill look different to the target, making it harder to track our traffic from \\nits source. This option is also considered “dynamic” because if one of the \\nproxies is down, it will skip to the next one.\\nGo back inside the /etc/proxychains.conf  file and comment out the lines \\ndynamic_chain  and strict_chain  by adding a # at the start of each line; then \\nuncomment the random_chain  line. We can only use one of these three \\noptions at a time, so make certain you comment out the other options \\nbefore using proxychains .\\nNext, find and uncomment the line with chain_len  and then give it a rea -\\nsonable number. This line determines how many of the IP addresses in your \\nchain will be used in creating your random proxy chain.\\n# dynamic_chain\\n#\\n# Dynamic – Each connection will be done via chained proxies\\n# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list\\n# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain\\n#\\n# strict_chain\\n#\\n# Strict - Each connection will be done via chained proxies\\n# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list\\n# all proxies must be online to play in chain148   Chapter 13\\n# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app\\n#\\nrandom_chain\\n# Random - Each connection will be done via random proxy\\n# (or proxy chain, see chain_len) from the list.\\n# this option is good to test your IDS :)\\n# Makes sense only if random_chain\\nchain_len = 3\\nHere, I have uncommented chain_len  and given it a value of 3, meaning \\nproxychains  will now use three proxies from my list in the /etc/proxychains.conf  \\nfile, choosing them randomly and moving onto the next one if a proxy is \\ndown. Note that although this method certainly enhances your anonymity, \\nit also increases the latency of your online activities.\\nNow that you know how to use proxychains , you can do your hacking \\nwith relative anonymity. I say “relative” because there is no surefire way to \\nremain anonymous with the NSA and FSB spying on our online activities—\\nbut we can make detection much  harder with the help of proxychains .\\nSecurity Concerns\\nAs a last note on proxy security, be sure to choose your proxies wisely: \\nproxychains  is only as good as the proxies you use. If you are intent on \\nremaining anonymous, do not use a free proxy, as mentioned earlier. \\nHackers use paid-for proxies that can be trusted. In fact, the free proxies \\nare likely selling your IP address and browsing history. As Bruce Schneier, \\nthe famous cryptographer and security expert, once said, “If something \\nis free, you’re not the customer; you’re the product.” In other words, any \\nfree product is likely gathering your data and selling it. Why else would \\nthey offer a proxy for free?\\nAlthough the IP address of your traffic leaving the proxy will be anon -\\nymous, there are other ways for surveillance agencies to identify you. For \\ninstance, the owner of the proxy will know your identity and, if pressured \\nenough by espionage or law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction, may \\noffer up your identity to protect their business. It’s important to be aware \\nof the limitations of proxies as a source of anonymity.\\nVirtual Private Networks\\nUsing a virtual private network (VPN)  can be an effective way to keep your \\nweb traffic relatively anonymous and secure. A VPN is used to connect to an \\nintermediary internet device such as a router that sends your traffic to its \\nultimate destination tagged with the IP address of the router.\\nUsing a VPN can certainly enhance your security and privacy, but it’s not \\na guarantee of anonymity. The internet device you connect to must record or \\nlog your IP address to be able to properly send the data back to you, so any -\\none able to access these records can uncover information about you.Becoming Secure and Anonymous    149The beauty of VPNs is that they are simple and easy to work with. You \\ncan open an account with a VPN provider and then seamlessly connect to \\nthe VPN each time you log on to your computer. You would use your browser \\nas usual to navigate the web, but it will appear to anyone watching that your \\ntraffic is coming from the IP address and location of the internet VPN device \\nand not your own. In addition, all traffic between you and the VPN device is \\nencrypted, so even your internet service provider can’t see your traffic.\\nAmong other things, a VPN can be effective in evading government-\\ncontrolled content and information censors. For instance, if your national \\ngovernment limits your access to websites with a particular political mes -\\nsage, you can likely use a VPN based outside your country in order to access \\nthat content. Some media corporations, such as Netflix, Hulu, and HBO, \\nlimit access to their content to IP addresses originating from their own \\nnation. Using a VPN based in a nation that those services allow can often \\nget you around those access limitations.\\nSome of the best and most popular commercial VPN services, accord -\\ning to CNET, are the following:\\n•\\tIPVanish\\n•\\tNordVPN\\n•\\tExpressVPN\\n•\\tCyberGhost\\n•\\tGolden Frog VPN\\n•\\tHide My Ass (HMA)\\n•\\tPrivate Internet Access\\n•\\tPureVPN\\n•\\tTorGuard\\n•\\tBuffered VPN\\nMost of these VPN services charge $50–$100 per year, and many offer \\na free 30-day trial. To find out more about how to set up a VPN, choose one \\nfrom the list and visit the website. You should find download, installation, \\nand usage instructions that are pretty easy to follow.\\nThe strength of a VPN is that all your traffic is encrypted when it leaves \\nyour computer, thus protecting you against snooping, and your IP address \\nis cloaked by the VPN IP address when you visit a site. As with a proxy \\nserver, the owner of the VPN has your originating IP address (otherwise \\nthey couldn’t send your traffic back to you). If they are pressured by espio -\\nnage agencies or law enforcement, they might give up your identity. One \\nway to prevent that is to use only VPNs that promise not to store or log \\nany of this information (and hope they are being truthful). In this way, if \\nsomeone insists that the VPN service provider turn over its data on its users, \\nthere is no data.150   Chapter 13Encrypted Email\\nFree commercial email services such as Gmail, Yahoo!, and Outlook Web \\nMail (formerly Hotmail) are free for a reason: they are vehicles for tracking \\nyour interests and serving up advertisements. As mentioned already, if a ser -\\nvice is free, you are the product, not the customer. In addition, the servers \\nof the email provider (Google, for example) have access to the unencrypted \\ncontents of your email, even if you’re using HTTPS.\\nOne way to prevent eavesdropping on your email is to use encrypted \\nemail. ProtonMail , shown in Figure 13-5, encrypts your email from end to \\nend or browser to browser. This means that your email is encrypted on \\nProtonMail servers—even the ProtonMail administrators can’t read your \\nemail.\\nProtonMail was founded by a group of young scientists at the CERN \\nsupercollider facility in Switzerland. The Swiss have a long and  storied his -\\ntory of protecting secrets (remember those Swiss bank accounts you’ve heard \\nso much about?), and ProtonMail’s servers are based in the European Union, \\nwhich has much stricter laws regarding the sharing of personal data than \\ndoes the United States. ProtonMail does not charge for a basic account but \\noffers premium accounts for a nominal fee. It is important to note that when \\nexchanging email with non-ProtonMail users, there is the potential for some \\nor all of the email not to be encrypted. See the ProtonMail support know -\\nledge base for full details.\\nFigure 13-5: The ProtonMail login screenBecoming Secure and Anonymous    151Summary\\nWe are constantly being surveilled by commercial firms and national intel -\\nligence agencies. To keep your data and web travels secure, you need to \\nimplement at least one of the security measures discussed in this chapter. \\nBy employing them in combination, you can minimize your footprint on \\nthe web and keep your data much more secure.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 14, try out the skills you learned from this \\nchapter by completing the following exercises:\\n1.

If \\nsomeone can hack a wireless connection, they can gain \\nentry to a device and access to confidential informa -\\ntion. The first step, of course, is to learn how to find \\nthese devices.\\nIn Chapter 3, we looked at some basic networking commands in Linux, \\nincluding some of the fundamentals of wireless networking, with a promise \\nof more wireless networking to come in Chapter 14. As promised, here we \\nexamine two of the most common wireless technologies in Linux: Wi-Fi and \\nBluetooth.154   Chapter 14Wi-Fi Networks\\nWe’ll start with Wi-Fi. In this section, I’ll show you how to find, examine, and \\nconnect to Wi-Fi access points. Before doing so, let’s spend a bit of time going \\nover some basic Wi-Fi terms and technologies to help you better understand \\nthe output from a lot of the queries we’ll make in this chapter:\\nAP (access point)  This is the device wireless users connect to for \\ninternet access.\\nESSID (extended service set identifier)  This is the same as the SSID, \\nwhich we discussed in Chapter 3, but it can be used for multiple APs in \\na wireless LAN.\\nBSSID (basic service set identifier)  This is the unique identifier of \\neach AP, and it is the same as the MAC address of the device.\\nSSID (service set identifier)   This is the name of the network.\\nChannels  Wi-Fi can operate on any one of 14 channels (1–14). In the \\nUnited States, Wi-Fi is limited to channels 1–11.\\nPower  The closer you are to the Wi-Fi AP, the greater the power, and \\nthe easier the connection is to crack.\\nSecurity  This is the security protocol used on the Wi-Fi AP that is \\nbeing read from. There are three primary security protocols for Wi-Fi. \\nThe original, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) , was badly flawed and eas -\\nily cracked. Its replacement, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) , was a bit more \\nsecure. Finally, WPA2-PSK, which is much more secure and uses a pre -\\nshared key (PSK) that all users share, is now used by nearly all Wi-Fi \\nAPs (except enterprise Wi-Fi).\\nModes  Wi-Fi can operate in one of three modes: managed, master, or \\nmonitor. You’ll learn what these modes mean in the following section. \\nWireless range  In the United States, a Wi-Fi AP must legally broadcast \\nits signal at an upper limit of 0.5 watts. At this power, it has a normal \\nrange of about 300 feet (100 meters). High-gain antennas can extend \\nthis range to as much as 20 miles.\\nFrequency  Wi-Fi is designed to operate on 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Modern \\nWi-Fi APs and wireless network cards often use both.\\nBasic Wireless Commands\\nIn Chapter 3, you were introduced to the basic Linux networking command \\nifconfig , which lists each activated network interface on your system along \\nwith some basic statistics, including (most importantly) the IP address of \\neach interface. Let’s take another look at your results from running ifconfig  \\nand focus on the wireless connections this time.\\nkali >ifconfig\\neth0Linkencap:EthernetHWaddr 00:0c:29:ba:82:0f\\ninet addr:192:168.181.131 Bcast:192.168.181.255 Mask:255.255.255.0\\n--snip--Understanding and Inspecting Wireless Networks    155lo Linkencap:Local Loopback\\ninet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0\\n--snip--\\nu wlan0 Link encap:EthernetHWaddr 00:c0:ca:3f:ee:02\\nThe Wi-Fi interface here is shown as wlan0  u. In Kali Linux, Wi-Fi inter -\\nfaces are usually designated as wlan X, with X representing the number of \\nthat interface. In other words, the first Wi-Fi adapter on your system would \\nbe labeled wlan0, the second wlan1, and so on.\\nIf you just want to see your Wi-Fi interfaces and their statistics, Linux \\nhas a specific command that’s similar to ifconfig  but dedicated to wireless. \\nThat command is iwconfig . When you enter it, only your wireless interfaces \\nand their key data are displayed:\\nkali >iwconfig\\nlo    no wireless extensions\\nwlan0 IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:off/any\\n      Mode:Managed  Access Point:Not-Associated   Tx-Power=20 dBm\\n      Retry short limit:7   RTS  thr:off   Fragment thr:off\\n      Encryption key:off\\n      Power Management:off\\neth0  no wireless extensions\\nHere, we see just the wireless interfaces, also known as network cards , \\nand key data about them, including the wireless standard utilized, whether \\nthe ESSID is off, and the mode. The mode has three settings: managed , \\nwhich means it is ready to join or has joined an AP; master , which means it \\nis ready to act as or already is an AP; and monitor , which we’ll discuss a little \\nlater in the chapter. We can also see whether any client has associated with \\nit and what its transmit power is, among other things. You can tell from this \\nexample that wlan0 is in the mode required to connect to a Wi-Fi network \\nbut is not connected to any yet. We will revisit this command again once the \\nwireless interface is connected to a Wi-Fi network.\\nIf you are not certain which Wi-Fi AP you want to connect to, you can \\nsee all the wireless access points your network card can reach using the \\niwlist  command. The syntax for iwlis t is as follows:\\niwlist interface  action\\nYou can perform multiple actions with iwlist . For our purposes, we’ll \\nuse the scan action to see all the Wi-Fi APs in your area. (Note that with \\na standard antenna, your range will be 300–500 feet, but this can be \\nextended with an inexpensive high-gain antenna.)\\nkali >iwlist wlan0 scan\\nwlan0       Scan completed:\\n            Cell 01 - Address: 88:AD:43:75:B3:82\\n                      Channel:1156   Chapter 14                      Frequency:2.412GHz (Channel 1)\\n                      Quality=70/70   Signal level =-38 dBm\\n                      Encryption key:off\\n                      ESSID:\"Hackers-Arise\"\\n--snip--\\nThe output from this command should include all Wi-Fi APs within \\nrange of your wireless interface, along with key data about each AP, such as \\nthe MAC address of the AP, the channel and frequency it is operating on, its \\nquality, its signal level, whether its encryption key is enabled, and its ESSID.\\nYou will need the MAC address of the target AP (BSSID), the MAC \\naddress of a client (another wireless network card), and the channel the AP \\nis operating on in order to perform any kind of hacking, so this is valuable \\ninformation.\\nAnother command that is very useful in managing your Wi-Fi connec -\\ntions is nmcli  (or the network manager command line interface ). The Linux \\ndaemon that provides a high-level interface for the network interfaces \\n(including the wireless ones) is known as the network manager . Generally, \\nLinux users are familiar with this daemon from its graphical user interface \\n(GUI), but it can also be used from the command line.\\nThe nmcli  command can be used to view the Wi-Fi APs near you and \\ntheir key data, as we did with iwlist , but this command gives us a little more \\ninformation. We use it in the format nmcli dev networktype , where dev is short \\nfor devices  and the type (in this case) is wifi, like so:\\nkali >nmcli dev wifi\\n*  SSID           MODE    CHAN  RATE           SIGNAL  BARS    SECURITY\\n   Hackers-Arise  Infra   1     54 Mbits/s     100             WPA1 WPA2\\n   Xfinitywifi    Infra   1     54 Mbits/s     75              WPA2\\n   TPTV1          Infra   11    54 Mbits/s     44              WPA1 WPA2\\n--snip--\\nIn addition to displaying the Wi-Fi APs within range and key data about \\nthem, including the SSID, the mode, the channel, the rate of transfer, the \\nsignal strength, and the security protocols enabled on the device, nmcli  can \\nbe used  connect to APs. The syntax to connect to an AP is as follows:\\nnmcli dev wifi connect AP-SSID password APpassword\\nSo, based on the results from our first command, we know there is an \\nAP with an SSID of Hackers-Arise . We also know it has WPA1 WPA2 security \\n(this means that the AP is capable of using both the older WPA1 and the \\nnewer WPA2), which means we will have to provide the password to connect \\nto the network. Fortunately, as it’s our AP, we know the password is 12345678, \\nso we can enter the following:\\nkali >nmcli dev wifi connect Hackers-Arise password 12345678\\nDevice \\'wlan0\\' successfully activated with \\'394a5bf4-8af4-36f8-49beda6cb530\\'.Understanding and Inspecting Wireless Networks    157Try this on a network you know, and then when you have successfully \\nconnected to that wireless AP, run iwconfig again to see what has changed. \\nHere’s my output from connecting to Hackers-Arise:\\nkali >iwconfig\\nlo    no wireless extensions\\nwlan0 IEEE 802.11bg   ESSID:\"Hackers-Arise\"\\n      Mode:Managed   Frequency:2.452GHz Access Point:00:25:9C:97:4F:48\\n      Bit Rate=12 Mbs Tx-Power=20 dBm\\n      Retry short limit:7   RTS  thr:off   Fragment thr:off\\n      Encryption key:off\\n      Power Management:off\\n      Link Quality=64/70  Signal level=-46 dBm\\n      Rx invalid nwid:0 Rx invalid crypt:0 Rx invalid frag:0\\n      Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:13  Missed beacon:0\\neth0  no wireless extensions\\nNote that now iwconfig has indicated that the ESSID is \" Hackers-Arise\"  \\nand that the AP is operating at a frequency of 2.452GHz. In a Wi-Fi net -\\nwork, it is possible for multiple APs to all be part of the same network, so \\nthere may be many APs that make up the Hackers-Arise  network. The MAC \\naddress 00:25:9C:97:4F:48 is, as you might expect, the MAC of the AP \\nI am connected to. What type of security a Wi-Fi network uses, whether \\nit is running at 2.4GHz or 5GHz, what its ESSID is, and what the AP’s \\nMAC address is are all critical pieces of information that are necessary for \\nWi-Fi hacking. Now that you know the basic commands, let’s get into some \\nhacking.\\nWi-Fi Recon with aircrack-ng\\nOne of the most popular exploits for new hackers to try is cracking Wi-Fi \\naccess points. As mentioned, before you can even consider attacking a \\nWi-Fi AP, you need the MAC address of the target AP (BSSID), the MAC \\naddress of a client, and the channel the AP is operating on.\\nWe can get all that information and more using the tools of the aircrack-\\nng suite. I’ve mentioned this suite of Wi-Fi hacking tools a few times before, \\nand now it’s time to actually use it. This suite of tools is included in every \\nversion of Kali, so you don’t need to download or install anything.\\nTo use these tools effectively, you first need to put your wireless network \\ncard into monitor mode  so that the card can see all the traffic passing its way. \\nNormally, a network card captures only traffic destined specifically for that \\ncard. Monitor mode is similar to promiscuous mode on wired network cards.\\nTo put your wireless network card in monitor mode, use the airmon-ng  \\ncommand from the aircrack-ng suite. The syntax for this command is simple:\\nairmon-ng start|stop|restart  interface158   Chapter 14So, if you want to put your wireless network card (designated wlan0) \\ninto monitor mode, you would enter the following:\\nkali >airmon-ng start wlan0\\nFound three processes that could cause trouble\\nIf airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, or airtun-ng stops working after\\na short period of time, you may want to run \\'airmon-ng check kill\\'\\n--snip--\\nPHY         INTERFACE         DRIVER      Chipset\\nphy0        wlan0             rt18187     Realtek Semiconductor Corp RTL8187\\n    (mac8311 monitor mode vif enabled for [phy0]wlan0 on [phy0]wlan0mon)\\n--snip--\\nThe stop and restart  commands, respectively, stop monitor mode and \\nrestart monitor mode if you run into trouble.\\nWith your wireless card in monitor mode, you can access all the wireless \\ntraffic passing by you within the range of your wireless network adapter and \\nantenna (standard is about 300–500 feet). Note that airmon-ng  will rename \\nyour wireless interface: mine has been renamed “wlan0mon,” though yours \\nmay be different. Make certain to note the new designated name of your \\nwireless interface because you’ll need that information in the next step.\\nNow we’ll use another tool from the aircrack-ng suite to find key data \\nfrom the wireless traffic. The airodump-ng  command captures and displays \\nthe key data from broadcasting APs and any clients connected to those \\nAPs or within the vicinity. The syntax here is straightforward: simply \\nplug in airdump-ng , followed by the interface name you got from running \\nairmon-ng just now. When you issue this command, your wireless card will \\npick up crucial information (listed next) from all the wireless traffic of \\nthe APs nearby:\\nBSSID  The MAC address of the AP or client\\nPWR  The strength of the signal\\nENC  The encryption used to secure the transmission\\n#Data  The data throughput rate\\nCH The channel the AP is operating on\\nESSID  The name of the AP\\nkali >airodump-ng wlan0mon\\nCH  9][  Elapsed: 28 s ][  2018-02-08 10:27\\nBSSID              PWR Beacons #Data #/s  CH MB  ENC   CIPHER  AUTH  ESSID\\n01:01:AA:BB:CC:22  -1        4    26   0  10 54e WPA2  CCMP   PSK  Hackers-\\nAriseUnderstanding and Inspecting Wireless Networks    159--snip--\\nBSSID               Station             PWR   Rate   Lost  Frames  Probe\\n(not associated)    01:01:AA:BB:CC:22\\n01:02:CC:DD:03:CF   A0:A3:E2:44:7C:E5\\nNote that airodump-ng  splits the output screen into an upper and lower \\nportion. The upper portion has information on the broadcasting APs, \\nincluding the BSSID, the power of the AP, how many beacon frames have \\nbeen detected, the data throughput rate, how many packets have traversed \\nthe wireless card, the channel (1–14), the theoretical throughput limit, the \\nencryption protocol, the cipher used for encryption, the authentication type, \\nand the ESSID (commonly referred to as SSID ). In the client portion, the \\noutput tells us that one client is not associated, meaning it has been detected \\nbut is not connected to any AP, and that another is associated with a station, \\nmeaning it’s connected to the AP at that address.\\nNow you have all the information you need to crack the AP! Although \\nit’s beyond the scope of this book, to crack the wireless AP, you need the \\n client MAC address, the AP MAC address, the channel the target is operat -\\ning on, and a password list.\\nSo to crack the Wi-Fi password, you would open three terminals. In the \\nfirst terminal, you would enter commands similar to the following, filling in \\nthe client and AP MAC addresses and the channel:\\nairodump-ng -c 10 --bssid 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22 -w Hackers-ArisePSK wlan0mon\\nThis command captures all the packets traversing the AP on channel 10 \\nusing the -c option.\\nIn another terminal, you can use the aireplay-ng  command to knock off \\n(deauthenticate) anyone connected to the AP and force them to reauthen -\\nticate to the AP, as shown next. When they reauthenticate, you can capture \\nthe hash of their password that is exchanged in the WPA2-PSK four-way \\nhandshake. The password hash will appear in the upper-right corner of the \\nairodump-ng  terminal.\\naireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22-c A0:A3:E2:44:7C:E5 wlan0mon\\nFinally, in the final terminal, you can use a password list ( wordlist.dic ) to \\nfind the password in the captured hash ( Hackers-ArisePSK.cap ), as shown here:\\naircrack-ng -w wordlist.dic -b 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22 Hacker-ArisePSK.cap\\nDetecting and Connecting to Bluetooth\\nThese days, nearly every gadget, mobile device, and system has Bluetooth \\nbuilt in, including our computers, smartphones, iPods, tablets, speakers, \\ngame controllers, keyboards, and many other devices. Being able to hack 160   Chapter 14Bluetooth can lead to the compromise of any information on the device, \\ncontrol of the device, and the ability to send unwanted info to and from the \\ndevice, among other things.\\nTo exploit the technology, we need to understand how it works. An in-\\ndepth understanding of Bluetooth is beyond the scope of this book, but I \\nwill give you some basic knowledge that will help you scan for and connect \\nto Bluetooth devices in preparation for hacking them.\\nHow Bluetooth Works\\nBluetooth is a universal protocol for low-power, near-field communication \\noperating at 2.4–2.485GHz using spread spectrum, frequency hopping \\nat 1,600 hops per second (this frequency hopping is a security measure). \\nIt was developed in 1994 by Ericsson Corp. of Sweden and named after \\nthe 10th-century Danish king Harald Bluetooth (note that Sweden and \\nDenmark were a single country in the 10th century).\\nThe Bluetooth specification has a minimum range of 10 meters, but \\nthere is no limit to the upper range manufacturers may implement in their \\ndevices. Many devices have ranges as large as 100 meters. With special \\nantennas, that range can be extended even farther.\\nConnecting two Bluetooth devices is referred to as pairing . Pretty much \\nany two Bluetooth devices can connect to each other, but they can pair only \\nif they are in discoverable mode. A Bluetooth device in discoverable mode \\ntransmits the following information:\\n•\\tName\\n•\\tClass\\n•\\tList of services\\n•\\tTechnical information\\nWhen the two devices pair, they exchange a secret or link key. Each \\nstores this link key so it can identify the other in future pairings.\\nEvery device has a unique 48-bit identifier (a MAC-like address) and \\nusually a manufacturer-assigned name. These will be useful pieces of data \\nwhen we want to identify and access a device.\\nBluetooth Scanning and Reconnaissance\\nLinux has an implementation of the Bluetooth protocol stack called BlueZ \\nthat we’ll use to scan for Bluetooth signals. Most Linux distributions, includ -\\ning Kali Linux, have it installed by default. If yours doesn’t, you can usually \\nfind it in your repository using the following command:\\nkali >apt-get install bluezUnderstanding and Inspecting Wireless Networks    161BlueZ has a number of simple tools we can use to manage and scan \\nBluetooth devices, including the following:\\nhciconfig  This tool operates very similarly to ifconfig  in Linux, but for \\nBluetooth devices. As you can see in Listing 14-1, I have used it to bring \\nup the Bluetooth interface and query the device for its specs.\\nhcitool  This inquiry tool can provide us with device name, device ID, \\ndevice class, and device clock information, which enables the devices to \\nwork synchronously.\\nhcidump  This tool enables us to sniff the Bluetooth communication, \\nmeaning we can capture data sent over the Bluetooth signal.\\nThe first scanning and reconnaissance step with Bluetooth is to check \\nwhether the Bluetooth adapter on the system we’re using is recognized and \\nenabled so we can use it to scan for other devices. We can do this with the \\nbuilt-in BlueZ tool hciconfig , as shown in Listing 14-1.\\nkali >hciconfig\\nhci0: Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB\\n      BD Address: 10:AE:60:58:F1:37  ACL  MTU: 310:10  SCO  MTU:  64:8\\n      UP RUNNING PSCAN INQUIRY\\n      RX bytes:131433 acl:45 sco:0 events:10519  errors:0\\n      TX bytes:42881  acl:45 sco:0 commands:5081 errors:0\\nListing 14-1: Scanning for a Bluetooth device\\nAs you can see, my Bluetooth adapter is recognized with a MAC address \\nof 10:AE:60:58:F1:37. This adapter has been named hci0. The next step is \\nto check that the connection is enabled, which we can also do with hciconfig  \\nby providing the name and the up command:\\nkali >hciconfig hci0 up\\nIf the command runs successfully, we should see no output, just a new \\nprompt.\\nGood, hci0 is up and ready! Let’s put it to work.\\nScanning for Bluetooth Devices with hcitool\\nNow that we know our adapter is up, we can use another tool in the BlueZ \\nsuite called hcitool , which is used to scan for other Bluetooth devices within \\nrange.\\nLet’s first use the scanning function of this tool to look for Bluetooth \\ndevices that are sending out their discover beacons, meaning they’re in dis -\\ncovery mode, with the simple scan command shown in Listing 14-2.\\nkali >hcitool scan\\nScanning...162   Chapter 14\\n      72:6E:46:65:72:66      ANDROID BT\\n      22:C5:96:08:5D:32      SCH-I535\\nListing 14-2: Scanning for Bluetooth devices in discovery mode\\nAs you can see, on my system, hcitool  found two devices, ANDROID BT \\nand SCH-I535. Yours will likely provide you with different output depend -\\ning on what devices you have around. For testing purposes, try putting your \\nphone or other Bluetooth device in discovery mode and see if it gets picked \\nup in the scan.\\nNow let’s gather more information about the detected devices with the \\ninquiry function inq:\\nkali >hcitool inq\\nInquiring...\\n    24:C5:96:08:5D:32    clock offset:0x4e8b      class:0x5a020c\\n    76:6F:46:65:72:67    clock offset:0x21c0      class:0x5a020c\\nThis gives us the MAC addresses of the devices, the clock offset , and the \\nclass of the devices. The class indicates what type of Bluetooth device you \\nfound, and you can look up the code and see what type of device it is by \\ngoing to the Bluetooth SIG site at https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/\\nassigned-numbers/service-discovery /.\\nThe tool hcitool  is a powerful command line interface to the Bluetooth \\nstack that can do many, many things.

The syntax is as follows:\\nsdptool browse MACaddress\\nListing 14-4 shows me using sdptool  to search for services on one of the \\ndevices detected earlier in Listing 14-2.\\nkali >sdptool browse 76:6E:46:63:72:66\\nBrowsing 76:6E:46:63:72:66...\\nService RecHandle: 0x10002\\nService Class ID List:\\n  \"\"(0x1800)\\nProtocol Descriptor List:\\n  \"L2CAP\"  (0x0100)\\n    PSM: 31\\n  \"ATT\" (0x0007)\\n    uint16: 0x0001\\n    uint16: 0x0005\\n--snip--\\nListing 14-4: Scanning with sdptool\\nHere, we can see that the sdptool  tool was able to pull information on \\nall the services this device is capable of using. In particular, we see that this \\ndevice supports the ATT Protocol, which is the Low Energy Attribute Protocol . \\nThis can provide us more clues as to what the device is and possibly poten -\\ntial avenues to interact with it further.\\nSeeing Whether the Devices Are Reachable with l2ping\\nOnce we’ve gathered the MAC addresses of all nearby devices, we can send \\nout pings to these devices, whether they’re in discovery mode or not, to see \\nwhether they are in reach. This lets us know whether they are active and \\nwithin range. To send out a ping, we use the l2ping  command with the fol -\\nlowing syntax:\\nl2ping MACaddress  -c NumberOfPackets\\nListing 14-5 shows me pinging the Android device discovered in \\nListing  14-2.\\nkali >l2ping 76:6E:46:63:72:66 -c 3\\nPing: 76:6E:46:63:72:66 from 10:AE:60:58:F1:37 (data size 44)...\\n44 bytes 76:6E:46:63:72:66 id 0 time 37.57ms164   Chapter 1444 bytes 76:6E:46:63:72:66 id 1 time 27.23ms\\n44 bytes 76:6E:46:63:72:66 id 2 time 27.59ms\\n3 sent, 3 received, 0% loss\\nListing 14-5: Pinging a Bluetooth device\\nThis output indicates that the device with the MAC address \\n76:6E:46:63:72:66 is within range and reachable. This is useful know-  \\n ledge, because we must know whether a device is reachable before we \\neven contemplate hacking it.\\nSummary\\nWireless devices represent the future of connectivity and hacking. Linux \\nhas developed specialized commands for scanning and connecting to Wi-Fi \\nAPs in the first step toward hacking those systems. The aircrack-ng suite of \\nwireless hacking tools includes both airmon-ng  and airodump-ng , which enable \\nus to scan and gather key information from in-range wireless devices. The \\nBlueZ suite includes hciconfig , hcitool , and other tools capable of scanning \\nand information gathering, which are necessary for hacking the Bluetooth \\ndevices within range. It also includes many other tools worth exploring.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 15, try out the skills you learned from this \\nchapter by completing the following exercises:\\n1.

Test whether those Bluetooth devices are within reachable distance with \\nl2ping .15\\nMANAGING THE LINUX KERNEL  \\nAND LOADABLE KERNEL MODULES\\nAll operating systems are made up of at least \\ntwo major components. The first and most \\nimportant of these is the kernel . The kernel is \\nat the center of the operating system and controls \\neverything the operating system does, including manag -\\ning memory, controlling the CPU, and even controlling \\nwhat the user sees on the screen. The second element of \\nthe operating system is often referred to as user land  and \\nincludes nearly everything else.\\nThe kernel is designed to be a protected or privileged area that can only \\nbe accessed by root or other privileged accounts. This is for good reason, as \\naccess to the kernel can provide nearly unfettered access to the operating \\nsystem. As a result, most operating systems provide users and services access \\nonly to user land, where the user can access nearly anything they need with -\\nout taking control of the operating system.166   Chapter 15Access to the kernel allows the user to change how the operating systems \\nworks, looks, and feels. It also allows them to crash the operating system, \\nmaking it unworkable. Despite this risk, in some cases, the system admin \\nmust very carefully access the kernel for operational and security reasons.\\nIn this chapter, we’ll examine how to alter the way the kernel works \\nand add new modules to the kernel. It probably goes without saying that \\nif a hacker can alter the target’s kernel, they can control the system. \\nFurthermore, an attacker may need to alter how the kernel functions for \\nsome attacks, such as a man-in-the middle (MITM) attack , where the hacker \\nplaces themselves between a client and server and can eavesdrop on or \\nalter the communication. First, we’ll take a closer look at the kernel struc -\\nture and its modules.\\nWhat Is a Kernel Module?\\nThe kernel is the central nervous system of your operating system, control -\\nling everything it does, including managing interactions between hard -\\nware components and starting the necessary services. The kernel operates \\nbetween the user applications you see and the hardware that runs every -\\nthing, like the CPU, memory, and hard drive.\\nLinux is a monolithic kernel that enables the addition of kernel modules. \\nAs such, modules can be added and removed from the kernel. The kernel will \\noccasionally need updating, which might entail installing new device drivers \\n(such as video cards, Bluetooth devices, or USB devices), filesystem drivers, \\nand even system extensions. These drivers must be embedded in the kernel \\nto be fully functional. In some systems, to add a driver, you have to rebuild, \\ncompile, and reboot the entire kernel, but Linux has the capability of adding \\nsome modules to the kernel without going through that entire process. These \\nmodules are referred to as loadable kernel modules , or LKMs .\\nLKMs have access to the lowest levels of the kernel by necessity, making \\nthem an incredibly vulnerable target for hackers. A particular type of mal -\\nware known as a rootkit  embeds itself into the kernel of the operating systems, \\noften through these LKMs. If malware embeds itself in the kernel, the hacker \\ncan take complete control of the operating system.\\nIf a hacker can get the Linux admin to load a new module to the \\nkernel, the hacker not only can gain control over the target system but, \\nbecause they’re operating at the kernel level of the operating system, can \\ncontrol what the target system is reporting in terms of processes, ports, \\nservices, hard drive space, and almost anything else you can think of.\\nSo, if a hacker can successfully tempt a Linux admin into installing a \\nvideo or other device driver that has a rootkit embedded in it, the hacker can \\ntake total control of the system and kernel. This is the way some of the most \\ninsidious rootkits take advantage of Linux and other operating systems.\\nUnderstanding LKMs is absolutely key to being an effective Linux \\nadmin and being a very effective and stealthy hacker.\\nLet’s take a look at how the kernel can be managed for good and ill.Managing the Linux Kernel and Loadable Kernel Modules    167Checking the Kernel Version\\nThe first step to understanding the kernel is to check what kernel your \\nsystem is running. There are at least two ways to do this. First, we can enter \\nthe following:\\nkali >uname -a\\nLinux Kali 4.19.0-kalil-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.13-lkalil (2019-01-03) x86_64\\nThe kernel responds by telling us the distribution our OS is running is \\nLinux Kali, the kernel build is 4.6.4, and the architecture it’s built for is the \\nx86_64 architecture. It also tells us it has symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) \\ncapabilities (meaning it can run on machines with multiple cores or pro -\\ncessers) and was built with kernel version 4.19.13 on January 3, 2019. Your \\noutput may be different, depending on which kernel was used in your build \\nand the CPU in your system. This information can be required when you \\ninstall or load a kernel driver, so it’s useful to understand how to get it.\\nOne other way to get this information, as well as some other useful \\ninformation, is to use the cat command on the /proc/version  file, like so:\\nkali >cat /proc/version\\nLinux version 4.19.0-kalil-amd64 (devel@kali.org) (gcc version 8.2.0 20190103\\n(Debian 8.2.0-13)   ) #1 SMP Debian 4.19.13-lkalil  (2019-01-03)\\nHere you can see that the /proc/version  file returned the same \\ninformation.\\nKernel Tuning with sysctl\\nWith the right commands, you can tune your kernel, meaning you can \\nchange memory allocations, enable networking features, and even harden \\nthe kernel against outside attacks.\\nModern Linux kernels use the sysctl  command to tune kernel options. \\nAll changes you make with sysctl  remain in effect only until you reboot the \\nsystem. To make any changes permanent, you have to edit the configuration \\nfile for sysctl  directly at /etc/sysctl.conf .\\nA word of warning: you need to be careful when using sysctl  because \\nwithout the proper knowledge and experience, you can easily make your \\nsystem unbootable and unusable. Make sure you’ve considered what you’re \\ndoing carefully before making any permanent changes.\\nLet’s take a look at the contents of sysctl  now. By now, you should rec -\\nognize the options we give with the command shown here:\\nkali >sysctl -a  | less\\ndev.cdrom.autoclose = 1\\ndev.cdrom.autoeject = 0\\ndev.cdrom.check_media = 0\\ndev.cdrom.debug = 0\\n--snip--168   Chapter 15In the output, you should see hundreds of lines of parameters that a \\nLinux administrator can edit to optimize the kernel. There are a few lines \\nhere that are useful to you as a hacker. As an example of how you might use \\nsysctl , we’ll look at enabling packet forwarding.\\nIn the man-in-the middle (MITM) attack, the hacker places themselves \\nbetween communicating hosts to intercept information. The traffic passes \\nthrough the hacker’s system, so they can view and possibly alter the commu -\\nnication. One way to achieve this routing is to enable packet forwarding.\\nIf you scroll down a few pages in the output or filter for “ipv4” \\n(sysctl -a | grep ipv4 | less ), you should see the following somewhere in \\nthe output:\\nnet.ipv4.ip_dynaddr = 0\\nnet.ipv4.ip_early_demux = 0\\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 0\\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward_use_pmtu = 0\\n--snip--\\nThe line net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0  is the kernel parameter that enables the \\nkernel to forward on the packets it receives. In other words, the packets it \\nreceives, it sends back out. The default setting is 0, which means that packet \\nforwarding is disabled.\\nTo enable IP forwarding, change the 0 to a 1 by entering the following:\\nkali >sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\\nRemember that that sysctl  changes take place at runtime but are lost \\nwhen the system is rebooted. To make permanent changes to sysctl , you \\nneed to edit configuration file /etc/sysctl.conf . Let’s change the way the \\nkernel handles IP forwarding for MITM attacks and make this change \\npermanent. \\nTo enable IP forwarding, open the /etc/sysctl.conf  file in any text editor \\nsuch as leafpad and uncomment the line for ip_forward . Open /etc/sycstl.conf  \\nwith any text editor and take a look:\\n#/etc/sysctl.conf - Configuration file for setting system variables\\n# See /etc/sysctl.d/ for additional system variables.\\n# See sysctl.conf (5) for information.\\n#\\n#kernel.domainname = example.com\\n# Uncomment the following to stop low-level messages on console.\\n#kernel.printk = 3 4 1 3\\n###############################################################\\n# Functions previously found in netbase\\n#\\n# Uncomment the next two lines to enable Spoof protection (reverse-path filter)\\n# Turn on Source Address Verification in all interfaces toManaging the Linux Kernel and Loadable Kernel Modules    169# prevent some spoofing attacks.\\n#net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1\\n#net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1\\n# Uncomment the next line to enable TCP/IP SYN cookies\\n# See http://lwn.net/Articles/277146\\n# Note: This may impact IPv6 TCP sessions too\\n#net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1\\nSee http://lwn.net/Articles/277146/  \\n# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4\\nu #net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\\nThe relevant line is at u ; just remove the comment ( #) here to enable \\nIP forwarding.\\nFrom an operating system–hardening perspective, you could use this file \\nto disable ICMP echo requests by adding the line net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_  \\nall=1  to make it more difficult—but not impossible—for hackers to find your \\nsystem. After adding the line, you will need to run the command sysctl -p .\\nManaging Kernel Modules\\nLinux has at least two ways to manage kernel modules. The older way is to \\nuse a group of commands built around the  insmod  suite—insmod  stands for \\ninsert module  and is intended to deal with modules. The second way, using \\nthe modprobe  command, we will employ a little later in this chapter. Here, we \\nuse the lsmod  command from the  insmod  suite to list the installed modules in \\nthe kernel:\\nkali >lsmod\\nModule                        Size       Used by\\nnfnetlink_queue               20480      0\\nnfnetlink_log                 201480     0\\nnfnetlink                     16384      2 nfnetlink_log, nfnetlink_queue\\nbluetooth                     516096     0rfkill                        28672      2 bluetooth\\n--snip--\\nAs you can see, the lsmod  command lists all the kernel modules as well \\nas information on their size and what other modules may use them. So, \\nfor instance, the nfnetlink  module—a message-based protocol for commu -\\nnicating between the kernel and user space—is 16,384 bytes and used by both the \\nnfnetlink_log  module and the nf_netlink_queue  module.\\nFrom the insmod  suite, we can load or insert a module with  insmod  and \\nremove a module with  rmmod , which stands for remove module. These com -\\nmands are not perfect and may not take into account module dependen -\\ncies, so using them can leave your kernel unstable or unusable. As a result, modern distributions of Linux have now added the \\nmodprobe  command, 170   Chapter 15which automatically loads dependencies and makes loading and removing \\nkernel modules less risky. We’ll cover modprobe  in a moment. First, let’s see \\nhow to get more information about our modules.\\nFinding More Information with modinfo\\nTo learn more about any of the kernel modules, we can use the modinfo  com -\\nmand. The syntax for this command is straightforward: modinfo  followed \\nby the name of the module you want to learn about. For example, if you \\nwanted to retrieve basic information on the bluetooth  kernel module you \\nsaw when you ran the lsmod  command earlier, you could enter the following:\\nkali >modinfo bluetooth\\nfilename:   /lib/modules/4.19.0-kali-amd64/kernel/net/bluetooth/bluetooth.ko\\nalias:      net-pf-31\\nlicense:    GPL\\nversion:    2.22\\ndescription:Bluetooth Core ver 2.22\\nauthor:     Marcel Holtman <marcel@holtmann.org>\\nsrcversion: 411D7802CC1783894E0D188\\ndepends:    rfkill, ecdh_generic, crc16\\nintree:     Y\\nvermagic:   4.19.0-kali1-amd64  SMP mod_unload modversions\\nparm:       disable_esco: Disable eSCO connection creation (bool)\\nparm:       disable_ertm: Disable enhanced retransmission mode (bool)\\nAs you can see, the modinfo  command reveals significant information \\nabout this kernel module which is necessary to use Bluetooth on your system. \\nNote that among many other things, it lists the module dependencies: rfkill , \\necdh_generic , and crc16 . Dependencies are modules that must be installed for \\nthe bluetooth  module to function properly.\\nTypically, this is useful information when troubleshooting why a partic -\\nular hardware device is not working. Besides noting things like the depen -\\ndencies, you can get information about the version of the module and the \\nversion of the kernel the module was developed for and then make sure \\nthey match the version you are running.\\nAdding and Removing Modules with modprobe\\nMost newer distributions of Linux, including Kali Linux, include the modprobe  \\ncommand for LKM management. To add a module to your kernel, you would \\nuse the modprobe  command with the -a (add) switch, like so:\\nkali >modprobe -a < module name >\\nTo remove a module, use the -r (remove) switch with modprobe  followed \\nby the name of the module:\\nkali >modprobe -r < module to be removed >Managing the Linux Kernel and Loadable Kernel Modules    171A major advantage of using modprobe  instead of insmod  is that modprobe  \\nunderstands dependencies, options, and installation and removal proce -\\ndures and it takes all of these into account before making changes. Thus, it \\nis easier and safer to add and remove kernel modules with modprobe .\\nInserting and Removing a Kernel Module\\nLet’s try inserting and removing a test module to help you familiarize your -\\nself with this process. Let’s imagine that you just installed a new video card \\nand you need to install the drivers for it. Remember, drivers for devices are \\nusually installed directly into the kernel to give them the necessary access \\nto function properly. This also makes drivers fertile ground for malicious \\nhackers to install a rootkit or other listening device.\\nLet’s assume for demonstration purposes (don’t actually run these com-   \\nmands) that we want to add a new video driver named HackersAriseNewVideo. \\nYou can add it to your kernel by entering the following:\\nkali >modprobe -a HackersAriseNewVideo\\nTo test whether the new module loaded properly, you can run the dmesg  \\ncommand, which prints out the message buffer from the kernel, and then \\nfilter for “video” and look for any alerts that would indicate a problem:\\nkali >dmesg | grep video\\nIf there are any kernel messages with the word “video” in them, they \\nwill be displayed here. If nothing appears, there are no messages contain -\\ning that keyword.\\nThen, to remove this same module, you can enter the same command \\nbut with the -r (remove) switch:\\nkali >modprobe -r HackersAriseNewVideo\\nRemember, the loadable kernel modules are a convenience to a Linux \\nuser/admin, but they are also a major security weakness and one that pro -\\nfessional hackers should be familiar with. As I said before, the LKMs can be \\nthe perfect vehicle to get your rootkit into the kernel and wreak havoc!\\nSummary\\nThe kernel is crucial to the overall operation of the operating system, and \\nas such, it is a protected area. Anything that’s inadvertently added to the \\nkernel can disrupt the operating system and even take control of it.\\nLKMs enable the system administrator to add modules directly into the \\nkernel without having to rebuild the entire kernel each time they want to \\nadd a module.172   Chapter 15If a hacker can convince the system admin to add a malicious LKM, the \\nhacker can take complete control of the system, often without the system \\nadmin even being aware.\\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 16, try out the skills you learned from this \\nchapter by completing the following exercises:\\n1. Check the version of your kernel.\\n2. List the modules in your kernel.\\n3. Enable IP forwarding with a sysctl  command.\\n4. Edit your /etc/sysctl.conf  file to enable IP forwarding. Now, disable IP \\nforwarding.\\n5. Select one kernel module and learn more about it using modinfo .16\\nAUTOMATING TASKS WITH  \\nJOB  SCHEDULING\\nLike anyone using Linux, the hacker often \\nhas jobs, scripts or other tasks, that they \\nwant to run periodically. You might, for \\nexample, want to schedule automatic regular file \\nbackups of your system, or maybe you want to rotate \\nlog files as we did in Chapter 11. The hacker, on the \\nother hand, may also want to have their system run \\nthe MySQLscanner.sh  script from Chapter 8 every \\nnight or while they’re at work or school. These are all examples of sched -\\nuling automatic jobs. Scheduling jobs allows you to run tasks without \\nhaving to think about it, and you can schedule jobs to run when you’re \\notherwise not using your system so you have plenty of free resources.\\nThe Linux admin—or the hacker for that matter—may also want to \\nset certain scripts or services to start automatically when their system boots \\nup. In Chapter 12, we looked at using the PostgreSQL database in associa -\\ntion with the hacker/pentest framework Metasploit. Rather than manually 174   Chapter 16starting the PostgreSQL database every time before starting Metasploit, you \\ncan have PostgreSQL—or any service or script—start automatically when \\nthe system boots up.\\nIn this chapter, you’ll learn more about how to use the cron daemon \\nand crontab  to set up scripts to run automatically, even while the system is \\nunattended. You’ll also learn how to set up startup scripts that automatically \\nrun whenever the system is booted, which will provide you with the neces -\\nsary services that you’ll need to run during your busy day of hacking.\\nScheduling an Event or Job to Run on an Automatic Basis \\nThe cron daemon and the cron table ( crontab ) are the most useful tools \\nfor scheduling regular tasks. The first, crond , is a daemon that runs in the \\nbackground. The cron daemon checks the cron table for which commands \\nto run at specified times. We can alter the cron table to schedule a task or \\njob to execute regularly on a particular day or date, at a particular time \\ndaily, or every so many weeks or months.\\nTo schedule these tasks or jobs, enter them into the cron table file, \\nlocated at /etc/crontab . The cron table has seven fields: the first five are used \\nto schedule the time to run the task, the sixth field specifies the user, and \\nthe seventh field is used for the absolute path to the command you want to \\nexecute. If we were using the cron table to schedule a script, we could simply \\nput the absolute path to the script in the seventh field.\\nEach of the five time fields represents a different element of time: \\nthe minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week, in that \\norder. Every element of time must be represented numerically, so March \\nis represented as 3 (you cannot simply input “March”). Days of the week \\nbegin at 0, which is Sunday, and end at 7, which is also Sunday. Table 16-1 \\nsummarizes this.\\nTable 16-1: Time Representations for Use in the crontab\\nField Time unit Representation\\n1 Minute 0–59\\n2 Hour 0–23\\n3 Day of the month 1–31\\n4 Month 1–12\\n5 Day of the week 0–7\\nSo, if we had written a script to scan the globe for vulnerable open \\nports and wanted it to run every night at 2:30 am, Monday through Friday, \\nwe could schedule it in the crontab  file. We will walk through the process of \\nhow to get this information into the crontab  shortly, but first let’s discuss the \\nformat we need to follow, shown in Listing 16-1.Automating Tasks with Job  Scheduling   175M  H  DOM  MON  DOW  USER  COMMAND\\n30 2  *    *    1-5  root  /root/myscanningscript\\nListing 16-1: The format for scheduling commands\\nThe crontab  file helpfully labels the columns for you. Note that the first \\nfield provides the minute ( 30), the second field provides the hour ( 2), the \\nfifth field provides the days ( 1-5, or Monday through Friday), the sixth field \\ndefines the user ( root), and the seventh field is the path to the script. The \\nthird and fourth fields contain asterisks ( *) because we want this script to \\nrun every day Monday through Friday regardless of the day of the month \\nor the month.\\nIn Listing 16-1, the fifth field defines a range for the day of the week by \\nusing a dash ( -) between the numbers. If you want to execute a script on \\nmultiple noncontiguous days of the week, you can separate those days with \\ncommas ( ,). Thus, Tuesday and Thursday would be 2,4.\\nTo edit crontab , you can run the crontab  command followed by the -e \\n(edit) option:\\nkali >crontab -e\\nSelect an editor. To change later, run \\'select-editor\\'.\\n1. /bin/nano   <----easiest\\n2. /usr/bin/mcedit\\n3. /usr/bin/vim.basic\\n4. /usr/bin/vim.gtk\\n5. /usr/bin/vim.tiny\\nChoose 1-5 [1]:\\nThe first time you run this command, it will ask which editor you would \\nlike to use. The default is /bin/nano , the option that tells you it’s the easiest. \\nIf you choose this option, the terminal will open directly to crontab .\\nAnother option, and often a better one for the newcomer to Linux, is to \\nopen crontab  directly in your favorite text editor, which you can do like so:\\nkali >leafpad /etc/crontab\\nI’ve used this command to open crontab  in Leafpad. You can see a snip -\\npet of the file in Listing 16-2.\\n# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab\\n# Unlike any other crontab, you don\\'t have to run the \\'crontab\\'\\n# command to install the new version when you edit this file\\n# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,\\n# which no other crontabs do.\\nSHELL=/bin/sh\\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin176   Chapter 16# m h dom mon dow user command\\n17 * * * * root cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\\n25 6 * * * root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron II ( cd / && run-parts\\n47 6 * * 7 root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron II ( cd / && run-parts\\n52 6 1 * * root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron II ( cd / && run-parts\\n#\\nListing 16-2: The crontab  file in use in a text editor\\nNow, to set a new regularly scheduled task, you simply need to enter a \\nnew line and save the file.\\nScheduling a Backup Task\\nLet’s view this utility first from the system administrator’s perspective. As a \\nsystem administrator, you’d often want to run backups of all your files after \\nhours, while the system is not being used and resources are readily avail -\\nable. (System backups tend to require system resources that are in short \\ndemand during business hours.) The ideal time might be in the middle of \\nthe night on the weekend. Rather than having to log in at 2 am on Saturday \\nnight/Sunday morning (I’m sure you have other priorities at that time), you \\ncould schedule the backup to start automatically at that time, even though \\nyou’re not at your computer.\\nNote that the hour field uses a 24-hour clock rather than using am and pm, \\nso 1 pm is, for example, 13:00. Also, note that the days of the week (DOW) \\nstart with Sunday (0) and end with Saturday (6).\\nTo create a job, you simply need to edit the crontab  file by adding a line \\nin the prescribed format. So, say you wanted to create a regular backup job \\nusing a user account named “backup.” You would write a script for backing up \\nthe system and save it as systembackup.sh  in the /bin directory, then schedule \\nthis backup to run every Saturday night/Sunday morning at 2 am by adding \\nthe following line to crontab :\\n00 2 * * 0 backup /bin/systembackup.sh\\nNote that the * wildcard is used to indicate “any,” and using it in place \\nof a digit for the day of the month, month, or day of the week is read as “all” \\ndays or months. If you read across this line, it says\\n1. At the top of the hour ( 00),\\n2. Of the second hour ( 2),\\n3. Of any day of the month ( *),\\n4. Of any month ( *),\\n5. On Sunday ( 0),\\n6. As the backup user,\\n7. Execute the script at /bin/systembackup.sh .Automating Tasks with Job  Scheduling   177The cron daemon will then execute that script every Sunday morning at \\n2 am, every month.\\nIf you only wanted the backup to run on the 15th and 30th of every \\nmonth, regardless of what days of the week those dates fell on, you could \\nrevise the entry in crontab  to appear as follows:\\n00 2 15,30 * * backup /root/systembackup.sh\\nNote that the day of the month (DOM) field now has 15,30. This tells \\nthe system to run the script only on the 15th and 30th of every month, so \\naround every two weeks. When you want to specify multiple days, hours, or \\nmonths, you need to list them separated by a comma, as we did here.\\nNext, let’s assume the company requires you to be especially vigilant \\nwith its backups. It can’t afford to lose even a day of data in the event of \\npower outage or system crash. You would then need to back up the data \\nevery weeknight by adding the following line:\\n00 23 * * 1-5 backup /root/systembackup.sh\\nThis job would run at 11 pm (hour 23), every day of the month, every \\nmonth, but only on Monday through Friday (days 1–5). Especially note that \\nwe designated the days Monday through Friday by providing an interval of \\ndays (1-5) separated by a dash ( -). This could have also been designated as \\n1,2,3,4,5 ; either way works perfectly fine.\\nUsing crontab to Schedule Your MySQLscanner\\nNow that you understand the basics of scheduling a job with the crontab  \\ncommand, let’s schedule the MySQLscanner.sh  script, which seeks out open \\nMySQL ports, that you built in Chapter 8. This scanner searches for systems \\nrunning MySQL by looking for open port 3306.\\nTo enter your MySQLscanner.sh  to the crontab  file, edit the file to provide \\nthe particulars of this job, just as we did with the system backups. We’ll \\nschedule it to run during the day while you’re at work so it doesn’t take up \\nresources when you’re using your home system. To do this, enter the follow -\\ning line in your crontab :\\n00 9 * * * user /usr/share/MySQLsscanner.sh\\nWe’ve set up the job to run at 00 minutes, at the ninth hour, every day of \\nthe month ( *), every month ( *), every day of the week ( *), and to run it as a \\nregular user. We simply need to save this crontab  file to schedule the job.\\nNow, let’s say you wanted to be particularly careful and only run this \\nscanner on weekends and at 2 am when it’s less likely that anyone is watch -\\ning the network traffic. You also only want it to run in the summer, June \\nthrough August. Your job would now look like this:\\n00 2 * 6-8 0,6 user /usr/share/MySQLsscanner.sh178   Chapter 16You would add this to your crontab  like so:\\n# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab\\n# Unlike any other crontab, you don\\'t have to run the \\'crontab\\'\\n# command to install the new version when you edit this file\\n# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,\\n# which none of the other crontabs do.\\nSHELL=/bin/sh\\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\\n# m h dom mon dow user command\\n17 * * * * root cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\\n25 6 * * * root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron II ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\\n47 6 * * 7 root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron II ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\\n52 6 1 * * root test -x /usr/sbin/anacron II ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )\\n00 2 * 6-8 0,6 user /usr/share/MySQLsscanner.sh\\nNow, your MySQLscanner.sh  will only run on weekends in June, July, and \\nAugust at 2 am.\\ncrontab Shortcuts\\nThe crontab  file has some built-in shortcuts you can use instead of a specify -\\ning the time, day, and month every time. These include the following:\\n•\\t@yearly\\n•\\t@annually\\n•\\t@monthly\\n•\\t@weekly\\n•\\t@daily\\n•\\t@midnight\\n•\\t@noon\\n•\\t@reboot\\nSo, if you wanted the MySQL scanner to run every night at midnight, \\nyou could add the following line to the crontab  file:\\n@midnight     user   /usr/share/MySQLsscanner.sh\\nUsing rc Scripts to Run Jobs at Startup\\nWhenever you start your Linux system, a number of scripts are run to set up \\nthe environment for you. These are known as the rc scripts. After the kernel \\nhas initialized and loaded all its modules, the kernel starts a daemon known Automating Tasks with Job  Scheduling   179as init or initd . This daemon then begins to run a number of scripts found in \\n/etc/init.d/rc . These scripts include commands for starting many of the ser -\\nvices necessary to run your Linux system as you expect.\\nLinux Runlevels\\nLinux has multiple runlevels that indicate what services should be started \\nat bootup. For instance, runlevel 1 is single-user mode, and services such \\nas networking are not started in runlevel 1. The rc scripts are set to run \\ndepending on what runlevel is selected:\\n0 Halt the system\\n1 Single-user/minimal mode\\n2–5 Multiuser modes\\n6 Reboot the system\\nAdding Services to rc.d\\nYou can add services for the rc.d script to run at startup using the update-rc.d  \\ncommand. This command enables you to add or remove services from the \\nrc.d script. The syntax for update-rc.d  is straightforward; you simply list the \\ncommand followed by the name of the script and then the action to perform, \\nlike so:\\nkali >update-rc.d < name of the script or service > <remove|defaults|disable|enable>\\nAs an example of how you can use update-rc.d , let’s assume you always \\nwant the PostgreSQL database to start upon system boot so that your \\nMetasploit framework can use it to store pentesting and hacking results. \\nYou would use update-rc.d  to add a line to your rc.d script to have it up and \\nrunning every time you boot your system.\\nBefore you do that, let’s check whether PostgreSQL is running on your \\nsystem already. You can do so using the ps command and piping it to a filter \\nlooking for PostgreSQL using grep, like so:\\nkali >ps aux | grep postgresql\\nroot   3876    0.0     0.0  12720    964pts/1    S+   14.24  0.00 grep postgresql\\nThis output tells us that the only process ps found running for PostgreSQL \\nwas the very command we ran looking for it, so there is no PostgreSQL data -\\nbase running on this system presently.\\nNow, let’s update our rc.d to have PostgreSQL run automatically at \\nbootup:\\nkali >update-rc.d postgresql defaults180   Chapter 16This adds the line to the rc.d file. You need to reboot the system for the \\nchange to take place. Once you’ve done that, let’s again use the ps command \\nwith grep to look for a PostgreSQL process:\\nkali >ps aux | grep postgresql\\npostgresql  757  0.0  0.1 287636  25180 ?    S  March 14   \\n0.00 /usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin/postgresql -D  \\n/var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main  \\n-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/9.6/main/postgresql.conf\\nroot   3876    0.0     0.0  12720    964pts/1    S+   14.24  0.00 grep postgresql\\nAs you can see, PostgreSQL is running without you ever entering any \\ncommands manually. It automatically starts when your system boots up, \\nready and waiting to be used with your Metasploit!\\nAdding Services to Your Bootup via a GUI\\nIf you’re more comfortable working from a GUI to add services at startup, \\nyou can download the rudimentary GUI-based tool rcconf from the Kali \\nrepository, like so:\\nkali >apt-get install rcconf\\nOnce it has completed its installation, you can start rcconf by entering \\nthe following:\\nkali >rcconf\\nThis will open a simple GUI like the one in Figure 16-1. You can then \\nscroll through the available services, select the ones you want to start upon \\nbootup, and click OK.\\nFigure 16-1: The rcconf GUI for adding services to startupAutomating Tasks with Job  Scheduling   181In this figure, you can see the PostgreSQL service listed second from \\nlast. Press the spacebar to select this service, press tab to highlight <Ok>, \\nand then press enter . The next time you boot Kali, PostgreSQL will start \\nautomatically.\\nSummary\\nBoth system administrators and hackers often need to schedule services, \\nscripts, and utilities to run at regular intervals. Linux enables you to schedule \\nnearly any script or utility to run on a regular basis using the cron daemon, \\nwhich runs these jobs from the cron table. In addition, you can have services \\nstart automatically at bootup by using the command update-rc.d  or the GUI-\\nbased tool rcconf to update the rc.d scripts. \\nEXERCISES\\nBefore you move on to Chapter 17 , try out the skills you learned from this \\nchapter by completing the following exercises:\\n1. Schedule your MySQLscanner.sh  script to run every Wednesday at 3 PM.\\n2. Schedule your MySQLscanner.sh  script to run every 10th day of the month \\nin April, June, and August.\\n3. Schedule your MySQLscanner.sh  script to run every Tuesday through \\nThursday at 10 AM.\\n4. Schedule your MySQLscanner.sh  script to run daily at noon using the \\nshortcuts.\\n5. Update your rc.d script to run PostgreSQL  every time your system boots.\\n6. Download and install rcconf and add the PostgreSQL  and MySQL data -\\nbases to start at bootup.17\\nPYTHON SCRIPTING BASICS  \\nFOR HACKERS\\nBasic scripting skills are critical to becoming \\na master hacker. Without having developed \\nsome basic scripting skills, a beginner hacker \\nwho simply uses tools created by someone else \\nwill be condemned to the realm of script kiddies . This \\nmeans that you will be limited to using tools developed by someone else, \\nwhich decreases your probability of success and increases your probability \\nof detection by antivirus (AV) software, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), \\nand law enforcement. With some scripting skills, you can elevate yourself \\nto the upper echelon of the master hackers!\\nIn Chapter 8, we covered bash scripting basics and built some simple \\nscripts, including MySQLScanner.sh , which finds systems running the ubi\\xad\\nqui tous MySQL database system. In this chapter, we begin looking at the \\nscripting language most widely used by hackers: Python. Many of the most \\npopular hacker tools are written in Python, including sqlmap, scapy, the \\nSocial \\xadEngineer Toolkit (SET), w3af, and many more.\\nPython has some important features that make it particularly well \\xad\\nsuited for hacking, but probably most importantly, it has a huge variety 184   Chapter 17of libraries—prebuilt modules of code that can be imported externally \\nand reused—that provide some powerful functionality. Python ships with \\nover 1,000 modules built in, and many more are available in various other \\nrepositories.\\nBuilding hacking tools is possible in other languages too, such as \\nbash, Perl, and Ruby, but Python’s modules make building these tools \\nmuch easier.\\nAdding Python Modules\\nWhen you install Python, you also install its set of standard libraries and \\nmodules that provide an extensive range of capabilities, including built \\xadin \\ndata types, exception handling, numeric and math modules, file handling, \\ncryptographic services, internet data handling, and interaction with internet \\nprotocols (IPs).\\nDespite all the power offered by these standard libraries and modules, \\nyou may need or want additional third \\xadparty modules. The third \\xadparty \\nmodules available for Python are extensive and are probably the reason \\nmost hackers prefer Python for scripting. You can find a comprehensive \\nlist of third \\xadparty modules at PyPI (the Python Package Index, shown in \\nFigure 17 \\xad1) at http://www.pypi.org/ .\\nFigure 17-1: The Python Package Index\\nUsing pip\\nPython has a package manager specifically for installing and manag \\xad\\ning Python packages known as pip (Pip Installs Packages). Since we are \\nworking with Python 3 here, you will need pip for Python 3 to download Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    185and install packages. Pip should be included by default, but if you need to, \\nyou can download and install pip from the Kali repository by entering the \\nfollowing:\\nkali >apt-get install python3-pip\\nNow, to download modules from PyPI, you can simply enter this:\\nkali >pip3 install < package name >\\nWhen you download these packages, they are automatically placed in the \\n/usr/local//lib/<python-version>/dist-packages  directory. So, for instance, if you \\nhad used pip to install the Python implementation of the SNMP protocol for \\nPython 3.7, you would find it at /usr/local/lib/python3.6/pysnmp . If you aren’t \\nsure where a package has been placed on your system (sometimes different \\ndistributions of Linux use different directories), you can enter pip3 followed \\nby show and the package name, as shown here:\\nkali >pip3 show pysnmp\\nName: pysnmp\\nVersion: 4.4.4\\nSummary: SNMP library for Python\\nHome-page: https://github.com/etingof/pysnmp\\nAuthor: Ilya Etingof <etingof@gmail.com>\\nAuthor-email: etingof@gmail.com\\nLicense: BSD\\nLocation: usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages\\nRequires: ptsmi, pyansl, pycryptodomex\\nYou can see this gives you a lot of information about the package, \\nincluding the directory that holds it.\\nAs an alternative to using pip, you can download a package directly \\nfrom the site (make certain that is downloaded to the proper directory), \\nunpack it (see Chapter 9 on how to unpack software), and then run the \\nfollowing:\\nkali >python3 setup.py install\\nThis will install any unpacked packages that haven’t yet been installed.\\nInstalling Third-Party Modules\\nTo install a third \\xadparty module created by another member of the Python \\ncommunity (as opposed to an officially released Python package), you can \\nsimply use wget to download it from wherever it is being stored online, uncom \\xad\\npress the module, and then run the python setup.py install  command.\\nAs an example, let’s download and install the Python module for the \\nport\\xadscanning tool we used in Chapter 8, nmap, from its online repository \\nat https://xael.org .186   Chapter 17First, we need to download the module from xael.org :\\nkali >wget http://xael.org/norman/python/python-nmap/python-nmap-0.3.4.tar.gz\\n--2019-03-10 17:48:32-- http://xael.org/norman/python/python-nmap/python-nmap-\\n0.3.4.tar.gz\\nResolving xael.org (xael.org)...195.201.15.13\\nConnecting to xael.org (xael.org)|195.201.15.13|:80...connected.\\n--snip--\\n2019-03-10 17.48:34 (113 KB/s)  - \\'python-nmap-0.3.4.tar.gz\\' saved \\n[40307/40307]\\nHere, you can see we use the wget command and the full URL for the \\npackage. After the package has downloaded, you need to uncompress it \\nwith tar, as you learned in Chapter 9:\\nkali >tar -xzf python-nmap-0.3.4.tar.gz\\nThen change directories to the newly created directory:\\nkali >cd python-nmap-.03.4/\\nFinally, in that directory, install the new module by entering the \\nfollowing:\\nkali >~/python-nmap-0.3.4  >python setup.py install\\nrunning install\\nrunning build\\nrunning build_py\\ncreating build\\n--snip--\\nrunning install_egg_info\\nwriting /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/python_nmap-0.3.4.egg.info\\nInnumerable other modules can be obtained this way as well. Once \\nyou’ve installed this nmap module, you can use it in your Python scripts \\nby importing the module. More on this later. Now let’s get started on some \\nscripting.\\nGetting Started Scripting with Python\\nNow that you know how to install modules in Python, I want to cover some \\nof the basic concepts and terminology of Python, then the basic syntax. \\nAfter that, you’ll write some scripts that will be useful to hackers every \\xad\\nwhere and that I hope will demonstrate the power of Python.Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    187Just as with bash or any other scripting language, we can create Python \\nscripts using any text editor. For this chapter, to keep things simple, I advise \\nyou to use a simple text editor such as Leafpad, but it’s useful to know that a \\nnumber of integrated development environments , or IDEs, are available for use \\nwith Python. An IDE is like a text editor with other capabilities built in, such \\nas color \\xadcoding, debugging, and compiling capabilities. Kali has the IDE \\nPyCrust built in, but there are many more IDEs available to download, of \\nwhich the best is arguably JetBrain’s PyCharm . This is an excellent IDE with a \\nlot of enhancements that make learning Python easier and quicker. There is \\na professional version for purchase and a community edition that is free. You \\ncan find them at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ .\\nOnce you’ve completed this chapter, if you want to keep learning Python, \\nPyCharm is an excellent tool that will help you in your development. For now, \\nwe will use a basic text editor like Leafpad to keep things simple.\\nNote that learning any programming language takes time and a lot of \\nhard work. Be patient with yourself—attempt to master each of the small \\nscripts I provide before moving on.\\nFORMATTING IN PYTHON\\nOne difference between Python and some other scripting languages is that \\nformatting is critically important in Python. The Python interpreter uses the for -\\nmatting to determine how code is grouped. The particulars of the formatting \\nare less important than simply being consistent, particularly with your indenta -\\ntion levels.\\nIf you have a group of code lines that you start with double indentation, \\nfor example, you must be consistent with the double indentation throughout \\nthe entire block in order for Python to recognize that these code lines belong \\ntogether. This is different from scripting in other programming languages, where \\nformatting is optional and a best practice, but not required. You’ll notice this as \\nyou go through and practice; it’s something to always keep in mind!\\nVariables\\nNow, on to some more practical concepts in Python. A variable  is one of the \\nmost basic data types in programming, and you encountered it earlier in \\nChapter 8 with bash scripting. In simple terms, a variable is a name associ \\xad\\nated with a particular value such that whenever you use that name in your \\nprogram, it will invoke the associated value.\\nThe way it works is that the variable name points to data stored in a \\nmemory location, which may contain any kind of value, such as an integer, \\nreal number, string, floating \\xadpoint number, Boolean (true or false state \\xad\\nment), list, or dictionary. We’ll briefly cover all of these in this chapter.\\nTo become familiar with the basics, let’s create a simple script, shown in \\nListing 17 \\xad1, in Leafpad and save it as hackers-arise_greetings.py .188   Chapter 17#! /usr/bin/python3\\nname=\"OccupyTheWeb\"\\nprint(\"Greetings to \" + name + \" from Hackers-Arise. The Best Place to Learn Hacking!\")\\nListing 17-1: Your first Python program\\nThe first line simply tells your system that you want it to use the Python \\ninterpreter to run this program, rather than any other language. The sec \\xad\\nond line defines a variable called name and assigns a value to it (in this case, \\n\"OccupyTheWeb\" ). You should change this value to your own name. The value \\nof this variable is in the string  character data format, meaning the content is \\nenclosed in quotation marks and is treated like text. You can put numbers \\nin strings, too, and they will be treated like text, in that you won’t be able to \\nuse them in numerical calculations.\\nThe third line creates a print()  statement concatenating Greetings to  \\nwith the value in the name variable, followed by the text from Hackers-Arise.  \\nThe Best Place to Learn Hacking!  A print()  statement will display whatever you \\npass to it within the parentheses on your screen.\\nNow, before you can run this script, you need to give yourself permission \\nto execute it. We need the chmod  command to do that. (For more information \\non Linux permissions, see Chapter 5).\\nkali >chmod 755 hackers-arise_greetings.py\\nJust as you did in Chapter 8 with bash scripting, to execute your script,  \\nprecede the script name with a period and forward slash. Your current \\ndirectory is not in the $PATH  variable for security reasons, so we need to pre \\xad\\ncede the script name with ./ to tell the system to look in the current direc \\xad\\ntory for the filename and execute it.\\nTo run this particular script, enter the following:\\nkali >./hackers-arise_greetings.py\\nGreetings to OccupyTheWeb from Hackers-Arise. The Best Place to Learn Hacking!\\nIn Python, each variable type is treated like a class. A class is a kind of \\ntemplate for creating objects. See “ Object \\xadOriented Programming (OOP)” \\non page 192  for more information. In the following script, I have attempted \\nto demonstrate a few of the types of variables. Variables can hold more than \\njust strings.

This is useful for when you want to \\nrefer to or change a value by referring to a key name. For example, say you \\nhave a dictionary called fruit_color  configured like the following:\\nfruit_color = {\\'apple\\': \\'red\\', \\'grape\\': \\'green\\', orange: \\'orange\\'}\\nIf later in your script you want get the fruit_color  of the grape, you simply \\ncall it by its key:\\n     print(fruit_color[\\'grape\\'])\\nYou could also change values for particular keys; for example, here we \\nchange the color of the apple:\\n     fruit_color[\\'apple\\']= \\'green\\'\\nWe will discuss lists and dictionaries in more detail later in the chapter.\\nCreate this script in any text editor, save it as secondpythonscript.py , and \\nthen give yourself permission to execute it, like so:\\nkali >chmod 755 secondpythonscript.py\\nWhen we run this script, it prints the values of the string variable, the \\ninteger variable, and the floating \\xadpoint number variable, like so:\\nkali >./secondpythonscript.py\\nHackers-Arise Is the Best Place to Learn Hacking\\n12\\n3.1415190   Chapter 17NOTE  In Python, there is no need to declare a variable before assigning a value to it, as in \\nsome other programming languages.\\nComments\\nLike any other programming and scripting language, Python has the capabil \\xad\\nity for adding comments. Comments are simply parts of your code—words, \\nsentences, and even paragraphs—that explain what the code is meant to do. \\nPython will recognize comments in your code and ignore them. Although \\ncomments are not required, they’re incredibly helpful for when you come \\nback to your code two years later and can’t remember what it should do. \\nProgrammers often use comments to explain what a certain block of code \\ndoes or to explain the logic behind choosing a particular method of coding.\\nComments are ignored by the interpreter. This means that any lines \\ndesignated as comments are skipped by the interpreter, which simply \\ncontinues until it encounters a legitimate line of code. Python uses the # \\nsymbol to designate the start of single \\xadline comment. If you want to write \\nmultiline comments, you can use three double quotation marks ( \"\"\") at the \\nstart and end of the comment section.\\nAs you can see in the following script, I have added a short, multiline \\ncomment to our simple hackers-arise_greetings.py  script.\\n#! /usr/bin/python3\\n\"\"\"\\nThis is my first Python script with comments. Comments are used to help explain code to \\nourselves and fellow programmers. In this case, this simple script creates a greeting for \\nthe user.\\n\"\"\"\\nname = \"OccupyTheWeb\"\\nprint (\"Greetings to \"+name+\" from Hackers-Arise. The Best Place to Learn Hacking!\")\\nWhen we execute the script again, nothing changes compared to the \\nlast time it was executed, as you can see here:\\nkali >./hackers-arise_greetings.py\\nGreetings to OccupyTheWeb from Hackers-Arise. The Best Place to Learn Hacking!\\nIt runs exactly the same as it did in Listing 17 \\xad1, but now we have some \\ninfo about our script when we return to the code at a later time.\\nFunctions\\nFunctions in Python are bits of code that perform a particular action. The \\nprint()  statement you used earlier, for example, is a function that displays \\nwhatever values you pass to it. Python has a number of built \\xadin functions \\nyou can immediately import and use. Most of them are available on your \\ndefault installation of Python in Kali Linux, although many more are Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    191available from the downloadable libraries. Let’s take a look at just a few of \\nthe thousands of functions available to you:\\n•\\texit()  exits from a program.\\n•\\tfloat()  returns its argument as a floating \\xadpoint number. For example, \\nfloat(1)  would return 1.0.\\n•\\thelp()  displays help on the object specified by its argument.\\n•\\tint()  returns the integer portion of its argument (truncates).\\n•\\tlen()  returns the number of elements in a list or dictionary.\\n•\\tmax()  returns the maximum value from its argument (a list).\\n•\\topen()  opens the file in the mode specified by its arguments.\\n•\\trange()  returns a list of integers between two values specified by its \\narguments.\\n•\\tsorted()  takes a list as an argument and returns it with its elements in \\norder.\\n•\\ttype()  returns the type of its argument (for example, int, file, method, \\nfunction).\\nYou can also create your own functions to perform custom tasks. Since \\nthere are so many already built into the language, it’s always worth checking \\nwhether a function already exists before going through the effort of build \\xad\\ning it yourself. There are many ways to do this check. One is to look at the \\nofficial Python documentation available at https://docs.python.org . Choose \\nthe version you are working with and then select Library Reference .\\nLists\\nMany programming languages use arrays as a way to store multiple separate \\nobjects. An array  is a list of values that can be retrieved, deleted, replaced, \\nor worked with in various ways by referencing a particular value in the \\narray by its position in the list, known as its index. It’s important to note \\nthat Python, like many other programming environments, begins counting \\nindexes at 0, so the first element in a list is index 0, the second is index 1, \\nthe third is index 2, and so on. So, for instance, if we wanted to access the \\nthird value in the array, we could do so with array[2] . In Python, there are a \\nfew implementations of arrays, but probably the most common implementa \\xad\\ntion is known as lists. \\nLists in Python are iterable , which means that the list can provide \\nsuccessive elements when you run all the way through it (see “ Loops” on \\npage  198). This is useful because quite often when we use lists, we are \\nlooking through them to find a certain value, to print out values one by \\none, or to take values from one list and put them into another list.\\nSo, let’s imagine we need to display the fourth element in our list \\nHackersAriseList  from Listing 17 \\xad2. We can access that element and print \\nit by calling the list’s name, HackersAriseList , followed by the index of the \\nelement we want to access enclosed in square brackets.192   Chapter 17To test this, add the following line to the bottom of your secondpythonscript  \\n.py script to print the element at index 3 in HackersAriseList :\\n--snip--\\nprint (HackersAriseStringVariable)\\nprint (HackersAriseIntegerVariable)\\nprint (HackersAriseFloatingPointVariable)\\nprint (HackersAriseList[3])\\nWhen we run this script again, we can see that the new print  statement \\nprints 4 alongside the other output:\\nkali >./secondpythonscript.py\\nHackers-Arise Is the Best Place to Learn Hacking\\n12\\n3.1415\\n4\\nModules\\nA module  is simply a section of code saved into a separate file so you can use \\nit as many times as you need in your program without having to type it all \\nout again. If you want to use a module or any code from a module, you need \\nto import  it. As discussed earlier, using standard and third \\xadparty modules is \\none of the key features that makes Python so powerful for the hacker. If we \\nwanted to use the nmap module we installed earlier, we would add the follow \\xad\\ning line to our script:\\nimport nmap\\nLater in this chapter, we will use two very useful modules: socket and \\nftplib.\\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP)\\nBefore we delve deeper into Python, it’s probably worth taking a few \\nminutes to discuss the concept of object \\xadoriented programming (OOP). \\nPython, like many programming languages today (C++, Java, and Ruby, to \\nname a few) adheres to the OOP model.\\nFigure 17 \\xad2 shows the basic concept behind OOP: the language’s main \\ntool is the object , which has properties in the form of attributes and states, as \\nwell as methods that are actions performed by or on the object.Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    193Object\\nMethod\\nFunction or procedureProperty\\nAttribute or state\\nFigure 17-2: Illustration of object-oriented programming\\nThe idea behind OOP\\xad based programming languages is to create \\nobjects that act like things in the real world. For example, a car is an object \\nthat has properties, such as its wheels, color, size, and engine type; it also \\nhas methods, which are the actions the car takes, such as accelerating and \\nlocking the doors. From the perspective of natural human language, an \\nobject is a noun, a property is an adjective, and a method is generally a verb.\\nObjects are members of a class, which is basically a template for creating \\nobjects with shared initial variables, properties, and methods. For instance, \\nsay we had a class called cars; our car (a BMW) would be a member of the \\nclass of cars. This class would also include other objects/cars, such as \\nMercedes and Audi, as shown in Figure 17 \\xad3.\\nClass\\nCarObjects\\nBMW\\nAudiMercedes\\nFigure 17-3: OOP classes and objects\\nClasses may also have subclasses. Our car class has a BMW subclass, and \\nan object of that subclass might be the model 320i.\\nEach object would have properties (make, model, year, and color) and \\nmethods (start, drive, and park), as shown in Figure 17 \\xad4.\\nProperties\\nmake\\nmodel\\nyear\\ncolorCar\\nBMW\\n320iMethods\\nstart\\ndrive\\npark\\nFigure 17-4: OOP properties and methods194   Chapter 17In OOP languages, objects inherit the characteristics of their class, so the \\nBMW 320i would inherit the start, drive, and park methods from class car.\\nThese OOP concepts are crucial to understanding how Python and other \\nOOP languages work, as you will see in the scripts in the following sections. \\nNetwork Communications in Python\\nBefore we move on to more Python concepts, let’s use what you’ve learned \\nso far to write a couple of hacking scripts to do with network connections.\\nBuilding a TCP Client\\nWe’ll create a network connection in Python using the socket  module. I’ve \\nalready mentioned that Python comes with a library of modules for a multi\\xad\\ntude of tasks. In this case, we will need the socket module to create a TCP \\nconnection. Let’s see it in action.\\nTake a look at the script in Listing 17 \\xad3 named HackersAriseSSHBanner  \\nGrab.py  (I know, it’s a long name, but bear with me here). A banner  is what \\nan application presents when someone or something connects to it. It’s kind \\nof like an application sending a greeting announcing what it is. Hackers use \\na technique known as banner grabbing  to find out crucial information about \\nwhat application or service is running on a port.\\n#! /usr/bin/python3\\nu import socket\\nv s = socket.socket()\\nw s.connect((\"127.0.0.1\", 22))\\nx answer = s.recv(1024)\\ny print(answer)\\ns.close()\\nListing 17-3: A banner-grabbing Python script\\nFirst, we import the socket module u so we can use its functions and \\ntools. Here, we’re going to use the networking tools from the socket module \\nto take care of interfacing a connection over the network for us. A socket \\nprovides a way for two computer nodes to communicate with each other. \\nUsually, one is a server and one is a client.\\nThen we create a new object, named s, instantiated from the socket  \\nclass from the socket module v. This way, we can now use this object to \\nperform further actions, such as connecting and reading data.\\nWe then use the connect()  method from the socket module w to make a \\nnetwork connection to a special IP and port. Remember that methods are \\nfunctions that are available for a particular object. The syntax is object Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    195.method  (for example, socket.connect ). In this case, I’m connecting to IP \\naddress 127.0.0.1, which is the IP address pointing back to localhost, the \\nsame machine this script is running on, and port 22, which is the default \\nSSH port. You can test this on another instance of Linux or Kali. Most have \\nport 22 open by default.\\nOnce you make the connection, there are a number of things you can \\ndo. Here, we use the receive method recv to read 1024 bytes of data from \\nthe socket x and store them in a variable named answer ; these 1024 bytes \\nwill contain the banner information. Then we print the contents of that \\nvariable to the screen with the print()  function y to see what data has been \\npassed over that socket, allowing us to spy on it! On the final line, we close \\nthe connection.\\nSave this script as HackersAriseSSHBannerGrab.py  and then change its \\npermissions using the chmod  command so that you can execute it.\\nLet’s run this script to connect to another Linux system (you might use \\nan Ubuntu system or even another Kali system) on port 22. If SSH is running \\non that port, we should be able to read the banner into our answer  variable \\nand print it to the screen, as shown here:\\nkali >./HackersAriseSSHBannerGrab.py\\nSSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.3p1 Debian-1\\nWe have just created a simple banner \\xadgrabbing Python script! We can \\nuse this script to find out what application, version, and operating system \\nare running at that IP address and port. This gives us key information a \\nhacker needs before attacking a system. This is essentially what the website \\nShodan.io  does for nearly every IP address on the planet, and it catalogs and \\nindexes this information for us to search.\\nCreating a TCP Listener\\nWe just created a TCP client that can make a connection to another TCP/IP \\naddress and port and then spy on the information being transmitted. That \\nsocket can also be used to create a TCP listener, to listen to connections \\nfrom outsiders to your server. Let’s try doing that next.\\nIn the Python script shown in Listing 17 \\xad4, you’ll create a socket on any \\nport of your system that, when someone connects to that socket, collects \\nkey information about the connector’s system. Enter the script and save it as \\ntcp_server.py . Make sure to give yourself execute permissions with chmod .\\n#! /usr/bin/python3\\nimport socket\\nu TCP_IP = \"192.168.181.190\"\\nTCP_PORT = 6996\\nBUFFER_SIZE = 100\\nv s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)196   Chapter 17w s.bind((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))\\nx s.listen(1)\\ny conn, addr = s.accept()\\nprint(\\'Connection address: \\', addr )\\nwhile True:\\n  data=conn.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)\\n  if not data:\\n      break\\n  print(\"Received data: \", data)\\n      conn.send(data)  #echo\\nconn.close()\\nListing 17-4: A TCP-listening Python script\\nWe declare that we want the script to run with the Python interpreter \\nand then import the socket module as before, so we can use its capabilities. \\nWe then define variables to hold information for the TCP/IP address, the \\nport to listen on, and the buffer size of the data we want to capture from \\nthe connecting system u.\\nWe define the socket v and bind the socket to the IP address and port w \\nusing the variables we just created. We tell the socket to listen using the \\nlisten()  method from the socket library x.\\nWe then capture the IP address and port of the connecting system \\nusing the socket library’s accept  method, and we print that information to \\nthe screen so the user can see it y. Notice the while True:  syntax here; we’ll \\ndiscuss this more later in the chapter, but for now just know that it is used \\nto run the indented code that comes after it indefinitely, meaning Python \\nkeeps checking for data until the program is stopped.\\nFinally, we place the information from the connecting system into a \\nbuffer, print it, and then close the connection.\\nNow, open a browser and browse to http://localhost:6996  to go to the \\n6996 port designated in our script. Run the tcp_server.py  script, and you \\nshould be able to connect and collect key information about that system, \\nincluding the IP address and port of the connecting system, as shown here:\\nkali >./tcp_server.py\\nConnection Address: (\\'192.168.181.190\\', 45368)\\nReceived data: Get /HTTP/1.1\\nHost:192.168.181.190:6996\\nUser -Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gec\\n--snip---\\nThis is critical information for a hacker to gather before deciding on an \\nexploit. Exploits (or hacks) are very specific to the operating system, appli \\xad\\ncation, and even language being used, so the hacker needs to know as much \\ninformation as possible about the target before proceeding. This act of Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    197gathering information prior to a hack is often referred to as reconnaissance . \\nYou just developed a tool that will gather key reconnaissance information \\non a potential target, very similar to the popular hacker tool p0F!\\nDictionaries, Loops, and Control Statements\\nLet’s keep expanding your understanding of Python and then use every \\xad\\nthing you’ve learned so far to build a password cracker for an FTP server.\\nDictionaries\\nDictionaries hold information as unordered pairs, where each pair contains \\na key and an associated value. We can use a dictionary to store a list of items \\nand give each item a label so we can use and refer to that item individually. \\nWe might use a dictionary to store, for example, user IDs and their associ \\xad\\nated names, or to store known vulnerabilities associated with a specific host. \\nDictionaries in Python act like associative arrays in other languages.\\nLike lists, dictionaries are iterable, meaning we use a control structure \\nsuch as a for statement to go through the entire dictionary, assigning each \\nelement of the dictionary to a variable until we come to the end of the \\ndictionary.\\nAmong other things, you might use this structure in building a pass \\xad\\nword cracker that iterates through each password stored in a dictionary \\nuntil one works or until the cracker comes to the end of the dictionary.\\nThe syntax for creating a dictionary is as follows:\\ndict = { key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3...}\\nNote that for dictionaries, you use curly brackets and separate items \\nwith a comma. You can include as many key \\xadvalue pairs as you like.\\nControl Statements\\nControl statements allows your code to make decisions based on some condi \\xad\\ntion. There are a number of ways in Python to control the flow of the script.\\nLet’s look at some of these structures in Python.\\nThe if Statement\\nThe if structure in Python, as in many other programming languages \\nincluding bash, is used to check whether a condition is true or not and \\nrun different sets of code for each scenario. The syntax looks like this:\\nif  conditional  expression :\\n    run this code if the expression is true\\nThe if statement contains a condition that might be something like \\nif variable  < 10 , for example. If the condition is met, the expression evaluates \\nto true, and then the code that follows, known as the control block , is executed. 198   Chapter 17If the statement evaluates to false, then the statements in the control block \\nare skipped over and not executed.\\nIn Python, lines that introduce a control block must end with a colon, \\nand the control block must be indented. This indentation identifies the \\ncontrol block to the interpreter. The next statement that is not indented is \\noutside the control block and therefore not part of the if statement, and \\nthis is how Python knows where to skip to if the condition is not met.\\nif...else\\nThe if...else  structure in Python looks like this:\\nif conditional  expression :\\n    *** # run this code when the condition is met\\nelse:\\n    *** # run this code when the condition is not met\\nAs before, first the interpreter checks the condition in the if expres \\xad\\nsion. If it evaluates to true, the interpreter executes the statements in the \\ncontrol block. If the conditional statement evaluates to false, the control \\nblock following the else statement is executed instead.\\nFor example, here we have a code snippet that checks the value of a user \\nID; if it is 0 (the root user in Linux is always UID 0), then we print the mes \\xad\\nsage “You are the root user.” Else, if it is any other value, we print the message \\n“You are NOT the root user.”\\nif userid == 0:\\n   print(\"You are the root user\")\\nelse:\\n   print(\"You are NOT the root user\")\\nLoops\\nLoops are another very useful structure in Python. Loops enable the pro \\xad\\ngrammer to repeat a code block multiple times, depending on a value or a \\ncondition. The two kinds of loops are while  and for.\\nThe while Loop\\nThe while  loop evaluates a Boolean expression (an expression that can evalu \\xad\\nate only to true or false) and continues execution while the expression evalu \\xad\\nates to true. For example, we could create a code snippet that prints each \\nnumber from 1 to 10 and then exits the loop, like so:\\ncount = 1\\nwhile (count <= 10):\\n   print(count)\\n   count += 1\\nThe indented control block then runs for as long as the condition is true.Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    199The for Loop\\nThe for loop can assign values from a list, string, dictionary, or other iter \\xad\\nable structure to an index variable each time through the loop, allowing us \\nto use each item in the structure one after the other. For example, we can \\nuse a for loop to attempt passwords until we find a match, like so:\\nfor password in passwords:\\n    attempt = connect(username, password)\\n    if attempt == \"230\":\\n       print(\"Password found: \" + password)\\n       sys.exit(0)\\nIn this code snippet, we create a for statement that continues through a \\nlist of passwords we have provided and attempts to connect with a username \\nand password. If the connection attempt receives a 230 code, which is the \\ncode for a successful FTP connection, the program prints \"Password found:\"  \\nand then the password. It then exits. If it does not get a 230, it will continue \\nthrough each of the remaining passwords until it receives a 230 or until it \\nexhausts the list of passwords.\\nImproving Our Hacking Scripts\\nNow with a bit more background in Python looping structures and condi \\xad\\ntional statements, let’s return to our banner \\xadgrabbing script and add some \\ncapabilities.\\nWe’ll add a list of ports that we want to grab the banner from, rather \\nthan just listening on one port, and then loop through the list using a for \\nstatement. In this way, we can search for and grab banners for multiple \\nports and display them to the screen.\\nFirst, let’s create a list and put additional ports in it. Open HackersArise  \\nSSHBannerGrab.py , and we’ll work from there. Listing 17 \\xad5 shows the full \\ncode. Note that the grayed \\xadout lines have stayed the same; the black lines \\nare the ones you need to change or add. We’ll try to grab banners for \\nports 21 (ftp), 22 (ssh), 25 (smtp), and 3306 (mysql).\\n#! /usr/bin/python3\\nimport socket\\nu Ports = [21, 22, 25, 3306]\\nv for Port in Ports:\\n  s = socket.socket()200   Chapter 17  print(\\'This Is the Banner for the Port\\')\\n  print(Port)\\nw   s.connect((\"192.168.1.101\", Port))\\n  answer = s.recv (1024)\\n  print(answer)\\n  s.close()\\nListing 17-5: Improving the banner grabber\\nWe create a list called Ports  u and add four elements, each representing \\na port. Then we create a for statement that iterates through that list four \\ntimes, since it has four items v.\\nRemember that when you’re using a for loop, the code associated with \\nthe loop must be indented beneath the for statement.\\nWe need to alter the program to reflect the use of a variable from the \\nlist on each iteration through. To do so, we create a variable named Port \\nand assign it to the value from the list at each iteration. Then we use that \\nvariable in our connection w.\\nWhen the interpreter comes to that statement, it will attempt to connect \\nto whichever port is assigned to the variable at the IP address.\\nNow, if you run this script on a system with all the ports listed open and \\nenabled, you should see something like Listing 17 \\xad6.\\nkali >./HackersArisePortBannerGrab.py\\nThis is the Banner for the Port\\n21\\n220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)\\nThis Is the Banner for the Port\\n22\\nSSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.7p1 Debian-8ubuntu1\\nThis Is the Banner for the Port\\n25\\n220 metasploitable.localdomain ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)\\nThis Is the Banner for the Port\\n3306\\n5.0.51a-3ubuntu5\\nListing 17-6: Output for the port banner grabber\\nNote that the script has found port 21 open with vsFTPd 2.3.4 running \\non it, port 22 open with OpenSSH 4.7 running on it, port 25 with Postfix, \\nand port 3306 with MySQL 5.0.51a.Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    201We have just successfully built a multiport banner \\xadgrabbing tool in \\nPython to perform reconnaissance on a target system. The tool tells us \\nwhich service is running on the port and the version of that service! This \\nis key information a hacker needs before proceeding with an attack.\\nExceptions and Password Crackers\\nAny code you write will be at risk of errors or exceptions. In programming \\nterms, an exception is anything that disrupts the normal flow of your code—\\nusually an error caused by incorrect code or input. To deal with possible \\nerrors, we use exception handling , which is simply code that handles a par \\xad\\nticular problem, presents an error message, or even uses an exception for \\ndecision making. In Python, we have the try/except  structure to handle \\nthese errors or exceptions.\\nA try block tries to execute some code, and if an error occurs, \\nthe except  statement handles that error. In some cases, we can use the \\ntry/except  structure for decision making, similar to if...else . For instance, \\nwe can use try/except  in a password cracker to try a password and, if an \\nerror occurs due to the password not matching, move to the next pass \\xad\\nword with the except  statement. Let’s try that now.\\nEnter the code in Listing 17 \\xad7 and save it as ftpcracker.py ; we’ll go through \\nit in a moment. This script asks the user for the FTP server number and the \\nusername of whichever FTP account they want to crack. It then reads in \\nan external text file containing a list of possible passwords and tries each \\none in an effort to crack into the FTP account. The script does this until it \\neither succeeds or runs out of passwords.\\n#! /usr/bin/python3\\nimport ftplib\\nu server = input(FTP Server: \")\\nv user = input(\"username: \")\\nw Passwordlist = input (\"Path to Password List > \")\\nx try:\\n  with open(Passwordlist, \\'r\\') as pw:\\n    for word in pw:\\ny     word = word.strip(\\'\\\\r\\\\n\\')\\nz     try:\\n        ftp = ftplib.FTP(server)\\n        ftp.login(user, word)202   Chapter 17{      print(Success!

Next, we create a variable named server  and another \\nvariable named user, which will store some commands for user input. Your \\nscript will prompt the user to enter the IP address of the FTP server u and \\nthe username for the account v the user is trying break into.\\nThen we ask the user for the path to the password list w. You can find \\nnumerous password lists in Kali Linux by entering locate wordlist  in a \\nterminal.\\nWe then begin the try block of code that will use the password list pro \\xad\\nvided by the user to attempt to crack the password for the username supplied \\nby the user.\\nNote that we use a new Python function called strip()  y. This function \\nremoves  all the leading and trailing characters of a string (in this case, from \\nthe word). This is necessary because iterating over the lines in this list will \\nleave the newline characters ( \\'\\\\n\\' and \\'\\\\r\\') at the end of the word. The \\nstrip()  function removes these and leaves just the string of characters of the \\npotential password. If we don’t strip the newline characters, we will get a \\nfalse negative.\\nThen, we use a second try z block. Here, we use the ftplib module to \\nfirst connect to the server using the IP address the user supplied and then \\ntry the next password from the password list on that account.\\nIf the combination of the username and password results in an error, \\nthe block exits and goes to the except  clause |, where it prints still trying  \\nand the text of the login error exception. Then, it returns to the top of the \\nfor clause and grabs the next password from the password list to try.\\nIf the combination succeeds, the successful password is printed to the \\nscreen {. The final line picks up any other situations that would otherwise \\nresult in errors and displays them. An example would be if the user input \\nsomething the program couldn’t process, such as bad path to the wordlist \\nor a missing wordlist.\\nNow, let\\'s run this script against the FTP server at 192.168.1.101 and see \\nwhether we can crack the password of the root user. I am using a password \\nlist named bigpasswordlist.txt  in my working directory. You may need to pro \\xad\\nvide the entire path to whichever password list you are using if it is not in \\nyour working directory (for example, /usr/share/bigpasswordlist.txt ).\\nkali >./ftpcracker.py\\nFTP Server:  192.168.1.101Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    203username: root\\nPath to PasswordList > bigpasswordlist.txt\\nstill trying...\\nstill trying...\\nstill trying...\\n--snip--\\nSuccess!

The majority of hacking tools are written in \\nPython, including sqlmap, scapy, and many others. Here, you have learned \\nsome Python fundamentals you can use to build some useful, yet simple \\nhacker tools, including a banner grabber and an FTP password cracker. To \\nlearn more Python, I strongly recommend No Starch Press’s excellent book \\nAutomate the Boring Stuff with Python  (2015) by Al Sweigart.\\nEXERCISES\\nTry out the skills you learned from this chapter by completing the following \\nexercises:\\n1. Build the SSH banner-grabbing tool from Listing 17-5 and then edit it to do \\na banner grab on port 21.\\n2. Rather than hardcoding the IP address into the script, edit your banner-\\ngrabbing tool so that it prompts the user for the IP address.\\n3. Edit your tcp_server.py  to prompt the user for the port to listen on.\\n4. Build the FTPcracker in Listing 17-7 and then edit it to use a wordlist for \\nuser variable (similar what we did with the password) rather than prompt -\\ning the user for input.\\n5. Add an except  clause to the banner-grabbing tool that prints “no answer” \\nif the port is closed.Symbols & Numbers\\n\"\"\" (comment) characters, 190\\n# (comment) character, 83\\n#!

Events in recent years seem to \\nreaffirm this statement with every morning’s \\nheadline. Nations are spying on each other to gain \\nsecrets, cyber criminals are stealing billions of dollars, digital worms',\n",
              " 'demanding ransoms are being released, adversaries are influencing each \\nother’s elections, and combatants are taking down each other’s utilities. \\nThese are all the work of hackers, and their influence over our increasingly \\ndigital world is just beginning to be felt.\\nI decided to write this book after working with tens of thousands of aspir -\\ning hackers through Null-Byte, https://www.hackers-arise.com/ , and nearly every \\nbranch of the US military and intelligence agencies (NSA, DIA, CIA, and \\nFBI). These experiences have taught me that many aspiring hackers have \\nhad little or no experience with Linux, and this lack of experience is the pri -\\nmary barrier to their starting the journey to becoming professional hackers. \\nAlmost all the best hacker tools are written in Linux, so some basic Linux \\nskills are a prerequisite to becoming a professional hacker. I have written this',\n",
              " 'book to help aspiring hackers get over this barrier.xxii   IntroductionHacking is an elite profession within the IT field. As such, it requires an \\nextensive and detailed understanding of IT concepts and technologies. At \\nthe most fundamental level, Linux is a requirement. I strongly suggest you \\ninvest time and energy into using and understanding it if you want to make \\nhacking and information security your career.\\nThis book is not intended for the experienced hacker or the experienced \\nLinux admin. Instead, it is intended for those who want to get started along \\nthe exciting path of hacking, cybersecurity, and pentesting. It is also intended \\nnot as a complete treatise on Linux or hacking but rather a starting point \\ninto these worlds. It begins with the essentials of Linux and extends into \\nsome basic scripting in both bash and Python. Wherever appropriate, I have \\ntried to use examples from the world of hacking to teach Linux principles.',\n",
              " 'In this introduction, we’ll look at the growth of ethical hacking for infor -\\nmation security, and I’ll take you through the process of installing a virtual \\nmachine so you can install Kali Linux on your system without disturbing the \\noperating system you are already running.\\nWhat’s in This Book\\nIn the first set of chapters you’ll  get comfortable with the fundamentals of \\nLinux; Chapter 1  will get you used to the file system and the terminal, and \\ngive you some basic commands. Chapter 2  shows you how to manipulate \\ntext to find, examine, and alter software and files. \\nIn Chapter 3  you’ll manage networks. You’ll scan for networks, find infor -\\nmation on connections, and disguise yourself by masking your network and \\nDNS information. \\nChapter 4  teaches you to add, remove, and update software, and how \\nto keep your system streamlined. In  Chapter 5 , you’ll manipulate file and \\ndirectory permissions to control who can access what. You’ll also learn some',\n",
              " 'privilege escalation techniques. \\nChapter 6  teaches you how to manage services, including starting and \\nstopping processes and allocating resources to give you greater control. In \\nChapter 7  you’ll manage environment variables for optimal performance, \\nconvenience, and even stealth. You’ll find and filter variables, change your \\nPATH variable, and create new environment variables. \\nChapter 8  introduces you to bash scripting, a staple for any serious \\nhacker. You’ll learn the basics of bash and build a script to scan for target \\nports that you might later infiltrate.\\nChapters 9  and 10  give you some essential file system management skills, \\nshowing you how to compress and archive files to keep your system clean, \\ncopy entire storage devices, and get information on files and connected disks. \\nThe latter chapters dig deeper into hacking topics. In Chapter  11 you’ll \\nuse and manipulate the logging system to get information on a target’s activ -',\n",
              " 'ity and cover your own tracks. Chapter 12  shows you how to use and abuse \\nthree core Linux services: Apache web server, OpenSSH, and MySQL. You’ll \\ncreate a web server, build a remote video spy, and learn about databases and \\ntheir vulnerabilities. Chapter 13  will show you how to stay secure and anony -\\nmous with proxy servers, the Tor network, VPNs, and encrypted email. Introduction   xxiiiChapter 14  deals with wireless networks. You’ll learn basic networking \\ncommands, then crack Wi-Fi access points and detect and connect to \\nBluetooth signals.\\nChapter 15  dives deeper into Linux itself with a high level view of how \\nthe kernel works and how its drivers can be abused to deliver malicious \\nsoftware. In Chapter 16  you’ll learn essential scheduling skills in order to \\nautomate your hacking scripts. Chapter 17  will teach you core Python con -\\ncepts, and you’ll script two hacking tools: a scanner to spy on TCP/IP con -\\nnections, and a simple password cracker.\\nWhat Is Ethical Hacking?',\n",
              " 'With the growth of the information security field in recent years has come \\ndramatic growth in the field of ethical hacking, also known as white hat  \\n(good guy) hacking. Ethical hacking is the practice of attempting to infil -\\ntrate and exploit a system in order to find out its weaknesses and better \\nsecure it. I segment the field of ethical hacking into two primary compo -\\nnents: penetration testing for a legitimate information security firm and \\nworking for your nation’s military or intelligence agencies. Both are rapidly \\ngrowing areas, and demand is strong.\\nPenetration Testing\\nAs organizations become increasingly security conscious and the cost of \\nsecurity breaches rises exponentially, many large organizations are begin -\\nning to contract out security services. One of these key security services is \\npenetration testing. A penetration test  is essentially a legal, commissioned \\nhack to demonstrate the vulnerability of a firm’s network and systems.',\n",
              " 'Generally, organizations conduct a vulnerability assessment first to find \\npotential vulnerabilities in their network, operating systems, and services. I \\nemphasize potential , as this vulnerability scan includes a significant number \\nof false positives (things identified as vulnerabilities that really are not). It is \\nthe role of the penetration tester to attempt to hack, or penetrate, these vul -\\nnerabilities. Only then can the organization know whether the vulnerability \\nis real and decide to invest time and money to close the vulnerability.\\nMilitary and Espionage\\nNearly every nation on earth now engages in cyber espionage and cyber war -\\nfare. One only needs to scan the headlines to see that cyber activities are the \\nchosen method for spying on and attacking military and industrial systems.\\nHacking plays a crucial part in these military and intelligence-gathering \\nactivities, and that will only be more true as time goes by. Imagine a war of',\n",
              " 'the future where hackers can gain access to their adversary’s war plans and \\nknock out their electric grid, oil refineries, and water systems. These activities \\nare taking place every day now. The hacker thus becomes a key component of \\ntheir nation’s defense.xxiv   IntroductionWhy Hackers Use Linux\\nSo why do hackers use Linux over other operating systems? Mostly because \\nLinux offers a far higher level of control via a few different methods.\\nLinux Is Open Source\\nUnlike Windows, Linux is open source, meaning that the source code of the \\noperating system is available to you. As such, you can change and manipulate \\nit as you please. If you are trying to make a system operate in ways it was not \\nintended to, being able to manipulate the source code is essential.\\nLinux Is Transparent\\nTo hack effectively, you must know and understand your operating system \\nand, to a large extent, the operating system you are attacking. Linux is totally',\n",
              " 'transparent, meaning we can see and manipulate all its working parts.\\nNot so with Windows. Microsoft tries hard to make it as difficult as \\npossible to know the inner workings of its operating systems, so you never \\nreally know what’s going on “under the hood,” whereas in Linux, you have \\na spotlight shining directly on each and every component of the operating \\nsystem. This makes working with Linux more effective.\\nLinux Offers Granular Control\\nLinux is granular. That means that you have an almost infinite amount of \\ncontrol over the system. In Windows, you can control only what Microsoft \\nallows you to control. In Linux, everything can be controlled by the terminal, \\nat the most miniscule level or the most macro level. In addition, Linux makes \\nscripting in any of the scripting languages simple and effective.\\nMost Hacking Tools Are Written for Linux\\nWell over 90 percent of all hacking tools are written for Linux. There are',\n",
              " 'exceptions, of course, such as Cain and Abel and Wikto, but those excep -\\ntions prove the rule. Even when hacking tools such as Metasploit or nmap \\nare ported for Windows, not all the capabilities transfer from Linux.\\nThe Future Belongs to Linux/Unix\\nThis might seem like a radical statement, but I firmly believe that the future \\nof information technology belongs to Linux and Unix systems. Microsoft \\nhad its day in the 1980s and 1990s, but its growth is slowing and stagnating.\\nSince the internet began, Linux/Unix has been the operating system \\nof choice for web servers due to its stability, reliability, and robustness. Even \\ntoday, Linux/Unix is used in two-thirds of web servers and dominates the \\nmarket. Embedded systems in routers, switches, and other devices almost \\nalways use a Linux kernel, and the world of virtualization is dominated by \\nLinux, with both VMware and Citrix built on the Linux kernel.\\nOver 80 percent of mobile devices run Unix or Linux (iOS is Unix,',\n",
              " 'and Android is Linux), so if you believe that the future of computing lies in Introduction   xxvmobile devices such as tablets and phones (it would be hard to argue other -\\nwise), then the future is Unix/Linux. Microsoft Windows has just 7 percent \\nof the mobile devices market. Is that the wagon you want to be hitched to?\\nDownloading Kali Linux\\nBefore getting started, you need to download and install Kali Linux on your \\ncomputer. This is the Linux distribution we will be working with throughout \\nthis book. Linux was first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as an open \\nsource alternative to Unix. Since it is open source, volunteer developers code \\nthe kernel, the utilities, and the applications. This means that there is no \\noverriding corporate entity overseeing development, and as a result, conven -\\ntions and standardization are often lacking.\\nKali Linux was developed by Offensive Security as a hacking operat -\\ning system built on a distribution of Linux called Debian. There are many',\n",
              " 'distributions of Linux, and Debian is one of the best. You are probably most \\nfamiliar with Ubuntu as a popular desktop distribution of Linux. Ubuntu is \\nalso built on Debian. Other distributions include Red Hat, CentOS, Mint, \\nArch, and SUSE. Although they all share the same Linux kernel (the heart \\nof the operating system that controls the CPU, RAM, and so on), each has its \\nown utilities, applications, and choice of graphical interface (GNOME, KDE, \\nand others) for different purposes. As a result, each of these distributions of \\nLinux looks and feels slightly different. Kali was designed for penetration tes -\\nters and hackers and comes with a significant complement of hacking tools.\\nI strongly recommend that you use Kali for this book. Although you can \\nuse another distribution, you will likely have to download and install the \\nvarious tools we will be using, which could mean many hours downloading \\nand installing tools. In addition, if that distribution is not built on Debian,',\n",

This part of the aircrack-ng suite deter-  \\n        mines the WEP key using two fundamental methods. The first method is  \\n        via the PTW approach (Pyshkin, Tews, Weinmann). The main advantage  \\n        of the PTW approach is that very few data packets are required to  \\n        crack the WEP key. The second method is the FMS/KoreK method. The  \\n        FMS/KoreK method incorporates various statistical attacks to dis-  \\n        cover the WEP key and uses these in combination with brute forcing.  \\n        Additionally, the program offers a dictionary method for determining',\n",

To exit, \\nsimply enter q (for quit), and you’ll return to the command prompt.\\nFinding Stuff\\nUntil you become familiar with Linux, it can be frustrating to find your way \\naround, but knowledge of a few basic commands and techniques will go a \\nlong way toward making the command line much friendlier.

In such a \\ncase, you can temporarily grant the owner’s privileges to execute the file by \\nsetting the SUID bit on the program.\\nBasically, the SUID bit says that any user can execute the file with the per -\\nmissions of the owner but those permissions don’t extend beyond the use of \\nthat file.58   Chapter 5',\n",

This means that, \\nwith an SGID bit set, someone without execute permission can execute a file if \\nthe owner belongs to the group that has permission to execute that file.\\nThe SGID bit works slightly differently when applied to a directory: when \\nthe bit is set on a directory, ownership of new files created in that directory \\ngoes to the directory creator’s group, rather than the file creator’s group. \\nThis is very useful when a directory is shared by multiple users.

As you saw when we ran the ps command, numerous processes \\nrun on the system at once, and all of them are contending for the available \\nresources. The kernel will have final say over the priority of a process, but \\nyou can use nice to suggest  that a process should be elevated in priority.\\nThe idea behind the use of the term nice is that, when you use it, you’re \\ndetermining how “nice” you’ll be to other users: if your process is using most \\nof the system resources, you aren’t being very nice.\\nThe values for nice range from −20 to +19, with zero being the default \\nvalue (see Figure 6 \\xad1). A high nice value translates to a low priority, and a \\nlow nice value translates to a high priority (when you’re not being so nice \\nto other users and processes). When a process is started, it inherits the nice',\n",

The syntax for these two commands is \\nslightly different and can be confusing. The nice command requires that \\nyou increment  the nice value, whereas the renice  command wants an absolute \\nvalue  for niceness. Let’s look at an example to demonstrate this.\\nSetting the Priority When Starting a Process\\nFor demonstration purposes, let’s assume we have a process named \\nslowprocess  that’s located at /bin/slowprocess .

In addition, renice  requires the PID of the \\nprocess you are targeting rather than the name. So, if slowprocess  is using \\nan inordinate amount of resources on your system and you want to give it',\n",

Among the areas that Linux new -\\ncomers find problematic, however, managing the user \\nenvironment variables might be the most difficult to \\nmaster. Technically, there are two types of variables: shell and environment. \\nEnvironment variables  are process-wide variables built into your system and \\ninterface that control the way your system looks, acts, and “feels” to the \\nuser, and they are inherited by any child shells or processes. Shell variables ,',\n",

To avoid over-explanation, I just cover some of the most \\nbasic and useful skills for environment and shell variables in this chapter.72   Chapter 7Variables are simply strings in key-value pairs. Generally, each pair will \\nlook like KEY=value . In cases where there are multiple values, they will look \\nlike KEY=value1:value2 . As with most things in Linux, if there are spaces in the \\nvalue, it needs to be contained in quotation marks. In Kali Linux, your envi -\\nronment is your bash shell. Each user, including root, has a default set of \\nenvironment variables that determine how the system looks, acts, and feels. \\nYou can change the values for these variables to make your system work \\nmore efficiently, tailor your work environment to best meet your individual \\nneeds, and potentially cover your tracks if you need to.\\nViewing and Modifying Environment Variables',\n",

What if you want to compress those files for ease of transport? \\nLinux has several commands capable of creating compressed files. We will \\nlook at these:\\n•\\tgzip, which uses the extension .tar.gz  or .tgz\\n•\\tbzip2 , which uses the extension .tar.bz2',\n",

The main reason you, as a budding hacker, should know \\nall three methods is that when accessing other tools, you will run into vari -\\nous types of compression. Therefore, this section shows you how to deal \\nwith the main methods of compression.\\nCompressing with gzip\\nLet’s try gzip (GNU zip) first, as it is the most commonly used compression \\nutility in Linux. You can compress your HackersArise.tar  file by entering the \\nfollowing (making sure you’re in the directory that holds the archived file):\\nkali >gzip HackersArise.*',\n",
              " 'Notice that we used the wildcard * for the file extension; this tells Linux \\nthat the command should apply to any file that begins with HackersArise  with \\nany file extension.

Also, notice that it has returned to \\nits original size of 40,960 bytes. Try doing a long list to confirm this. \\nCompressing with bzip2\\nAnother of the other widely used compression utilities in Linux is bzip2 ,',\n",
              " 'which works similarly to gzip but has better compression ratios, mean -\\ning that the resulting file will be even smaller. You can compress your \\nHackersArise.tar  file by entering the following:\\nkali >bzip2 HackersArise.*\\nWhen you do a long listing, you can see that bzip2  has compressed the \\nfile down to just 2,081 bytes! Also note that the file extension is now .tar.bz2 .\\nTo uncompress the compressed file, use bunzip2 , like so:\\nkali >bunzip2 HackersArise.*\\nkali >\\nWhen you do, the file returns to its original size, and its file extension \\nreturns to .tar.\\nCompressing with compress\\nFinally, you can use the command compress  to compress the file.

The dd command makes \\na bit-by-bit copy of a file, a filesystem, or even an entire hard drive. This \\nmeans that even deleted files are copied (yes, it’s important to know that \\nyour deleted files may be recoverable), making for easy discovery and \\nrecovery. Deleted files will not be copied with most logical copying utili -\\nties, such as cp.\\nOnce a hacker has owned a target system, the dd command will allow',\n",

In \\naddition, those people whose job it is to catch hackers—namely, forensic \\ninvestigators—will likely use this command to make a physical copy of the \\nhard drive with deleted files and other artifacts that might be useful for \\nfinding evidence against the hacker.\\nIt’s critical to note that the dd command should not be used for typical \\nday-to-day copying of files and storage devices because it is very slow; other \\ncommands do the job faster and more efficiently. It is, though, excellent \\nwhen you need a copy of a storage device without the filesystem or other \\nlogical structures, such as in a forensic investigation.\\nThe basic syntax for the dd command is as follows:\\ndd if=inputfile  of=outputfile\\nSo, if you wanted to make a physical copy of your flash drive, assuming \\nthe flash drive is sdb (we’ll discuss this designation more in Chapter 10), \\nyou would enter the following:\\nkali >dd if=/dev/sdb of=/root/flashcopy',\n",

As the name implies, the noerror  option \\ncontinues to copy even if errors are encountered. The bs option allows you \\nto determine the block size (the number of bytes read/written per block) of \\nthe data being copied. By default, it is set to 512 bytes, but it can be changed',\n",

For combining files, tar is the command of \\nchoice, and you have at least three utilities for compressing files— gzip, bzip2 , \\nand compress —all with different compression ratios. The dd command goes \\nabove and beyond.

We won’t go into all tracking methods, or into too much \\ndetail about any one method, as that would be beyond the scope of this book.',\n",
              " 'Indeed, such a discussion could take up an entire book on its own.\\nFirst, your IP address identifies you as you traverse the internet. Data \\nsent from your machine is generally tagged with your IP address, making \\nyour activities easy to track. Second, Google and other email services will \\n“read” your email, looking for keywords to more efficiently serve you ads. \\nAlthough there are many more sophisticated methods that are far more \\ntime and resource intensive, these are the ones we try to prevent in this \\nchapter. Let’s start by taking a look at how IP addresses give us away on the \\ninternet.\\nWhen you send a packet of data across the internet, it contains the IP \\naddresses of the source and destination for the data. In this way, the packet \\nknows where it is going and where to return the response. Each packet hops \\nthrough multiple internet routers until it finds its destination and then \\nhops back to the sender. For general internet surfing, each hop is a router',\n",
              " 'the packet passes through to get to its destination. There can be as many as \\n20–30 hops between the sender and the destination, but usually any packet \\nwill find its way to the destination in fewer than 15 hops.\\nAs the packet traverses the internet, anyone intercepting the packet can \\nsee who sent it, where it has been, and where it’s going. This is one way web -\\nsites can tell who you are when arrive and log you in automatically, and it’s \\nalso how someone can track where you’ve been on the internet.\\nTo see what hops a packet might make between you and the destination, \\nyou can use the traceroute  command, as shown next. Simply enter traceroute  \\nand the destination IP address or domain, and the command will send out \\npackets to the destination and trace the route of those packets.\\nkali >traceroute google.com\\ntraceroute to google.com (172.217.1.78), 30 hops max, 60 bytes packets\\n1   192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)   4.152 ms 3.834 ms 32.964 ms',\n",

In addition, packets don’t always take the same route across the Becoming Secure and Anonymous    141internet, so you might send another packet from your address to the same \\nsite and receive a different route. Let’s see how we can disguise all this with \\nthe Tor network.\\nThe Onion Router System\\nIn the 1990s, the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) set out to develop a \\nmethod for anonymously navigating the internet for espionage purposes. \\nThe plan was to set up a network of routers that was separate from the',\n",
              " 'internet’s routers, that could encrypt the traffic, and that only stored the \\nunencrypted IP address of the previous  router—meaning all other router \\naddresses along the way were encrypted. The idea was that anyone watching \\nthe traffic could not determine the origin or destination of the data. This \\nresearch became known as “The Onion Router (Tor) Project” in 2002, and \\nit’s now available to anyone to use for relatively safe and anonymous naviga -\\ntion on the web.\\nHow Tor Works\\nPackets sent over Tor are not sent over the regular routers so closely moni -\\ntored by so many but rather are sent over a network of over 7,000 routers \\naround the world, thanks to volunteers who allow their computers to be used \\nby Tor. On top of using a totally separate router network, Tor encrypts the \\ndata, destination, and sender IP address of each packet. At each hop, the \\ninformation is encrypted and then decrypted by the next hop when it’s',\n",
              " 'received. In this way, each packet contains information about only the pre -\\nvious hop along the path and not the IP address of the origin. If someone \\nintercepts the traffic, they can see only the IP address of the previous hop, \\nand the website owner can see only the IP address of the last router that \\nsent the traffic (see Figure 13-1). This ensures relative anonymity across \\nthe internet.\\nAnnie+\\n+ +\\nBill+Tor node\\nEncrypted path\\nClear path++\\nFigure 13-1: How Tor uses encrypted traffic data142   Chapter 13To enable the use of Tor, just install the Tor browser from https://www  \\n.torproject.org/ .

The \\nwebsites that make up the dark web require anonymity, so they allow access \\nonly through the Tor browser, and they have addresses ending in .onion  for \\ntheir top-level domain (TLD). The dark web is infamous for illegal activity, \\nbut a number of legitimate services are also available there. A word of cau -\\ntion, however: when accessing the dark web, you may come across material \\nthat many will find offensive.\\nSecurity Concerns\\nThe intelligence and spy services of the United States and other nations \\nconsider the Tor network a threat to national security, believing such an \\nanonymous network enables foreign governments and terrorists to com -\\nmunicate without being watched. As a result, a number of robust, ambi -',\n",
              " 'tious research projects are working to break the anonymity of Tor.\\nTor’s anonymity has been broken before by these authorities and will \\nlikely be broken again. The NSA, as one instance, runs its own Tor routers, \\nmeaning that your traffic may be traversing the NSA’s routers when you use Becoming Secure and Anonymous    143Tor. If your traffic is exiting the NSA’s routers, that’s even worse, because \\nthe exit router always knows your destination. The NSA also has a method \\nknown as traffic correlation , which involves looking for patterns in incoming \\nand outgoing traffic, that has been able to break Tor’s anonymity. Though \\nthese attempts to break Tor won’t affect Tor’s effectiveness at obscuring \\nyour identity from commercial services, such as Google, they may limit the \\nbrowser’s effectiveness in keeping you anonymous from spy agencies.\\nProxy Servers\\nAnother strategy for achieving anonymity on the internet is to use proxies ,',\n",
              " 'which are intermediate systems that act as middlemen for traffic: the user \\nconnects to a proxy, and the traffic is given the IP address of the proxy \\nbefore it’s passed on (see Figure 13-3).

The syntax for the proxychains  command \\nis straightforward, as shown here:\\nkali >proxychains < the command you want proxied > <arguments >\\nThe arguments you provide might include an IP address.

The kernel operates \\nbetween the user applications you see and the hardware that runs every -\\nthing, like the CPU, memory, and hard drive.\\nLinux is a monolithic kernel that enables the addition of kernel modules. \\nAs such, modules can be added and removed from the kernel. The kernel will \\noccasionally need updating, which might entail installing new device drivers \\n(such as video cards, Bluetooth devices, or USB devices), filesystem drivers,',\n",
              " 'and even system extensions. These drivers must be embedded in the kernel \\nto be fully functional. In some systems, to add a driver, you have to rebuild, \\ncompile, and reboot the entire kernel, but Linux has the capability of adding \\nsome modules to the kernel without going through that entire process. These \\nmodules are referred to as loadable kernel modules , or LKMs .\\nLKMs have access to the lowest levels of the kernel by necessity, making \\nthem an incredibly vulnerable target for hackers. A particular type of mal -\\nware known as a rootkit  embeds itself into the kernel of the operating systems, \\noften through these LKMs. If malware embeds itself in the kernel, the hacker \\ncan take complete control of the operating system.\\nIf a hacker can get the Linux admin to load a new module to the \\nkernel, the hacker not only can gain control over the target system but, \\nbecause they’re operating at the kernel level of the operating system, can',\n",

This is the way some of the most \\ninsidious rootkits take advantage of Linux and other operating systems.\\nUnderstanding LKMs is absolutely key to being an effective Linux \\nadmin and being a very effective and stealthy hacker.\\nLet’s take a look at how the kernel can be managed for good and ill.Managing the Linux Kernel and Loadable Kernel Modules    167Checking the Kernel Version\\nThe first step to understanding the kernel is to check what kernel your \\nsystem is running. There are at least two ways to do this. First, we can enter \\nthe following:\\nkali >uname -a\\nLinux Kali 4.19.0-kalil-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.13-lkalil (2019-01-03) x86_64',\n",

Your \\noutput may be different, depending on which kernel was used in your build \\nand the CPU in your system. This information can be required when you \\ninstall or load a kernel driver, so it’s useful to understand how to get it.\\nOne other way to get this information, as well as some other useful \\ninformation, is to use the cat command on the /proc/version  file, like so:\\nkali >cat /proc/version\\nLinux version 4.19.0-kalil-amd64 (devel@kali.org) (gcc version 8.2.0 20190103\\n(Debian 8.2.0-13)   ) #1 SMP Debian 4.19.13-lkalil  (2019-01-03)\\nHere you can see that the /proc/version  file returned the same \\ninformation.',\n",

The older way is to \\nuse a group of commands built around the  insmod  suite—insmod  stands for \\ninsert module  and is intended to deal with modules. The second way, using \\nthe modprobe  command, we will employ a little later in this chapter.

These com -\\nmands are not perfect and may not take into account module dependen -\\ncies, so using them can leave your kernel unstable or unusable. As a result, modern distributions of Linux have now added the \\nmodprobe  command, 170   Chapter 15which automatically loads dependencies and makes loading and removing \\nkernel modules less risky.

This act of Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    197gathering information prior to a hack is often referred to as reconnaissance . \\nYou just developed a tool that will gather key reconnaissance information \\non a potential target, very similar to the popular hacker tool p0F!\\nDictionaries, Loops, and Control Statements\\nLet’s keep expanding your understanding of Python and then use every \\xad\\nthing you’ve learned so far to build a password cracker for an FTP server.\\nDictionaries\\nDictionaries hold information as unordered pairs, where each pair contains \\na key and an associated value. We can use a dictionary to store a list of items',\n",
              " 'and give each item a label so we can use and refer to that item individually. \\nWe might use a dictionary to store, for example, user IDs and their associ \\xad\\nated names, or to store known vulnerabilities associated with a specific host. \\nDictionaries in Python act like associative arrays in other languages.\\nLike lists, dictionaries are iterable, meaning we use a control structure \\nsuch as a for statement to go through the entire dictionary, assigning each \\nelement of the dictionary to a variable until we come to the end of the \\ndictionary.\\nAmong other things, you might use this structure in building a pass \\xad\\nword cracker that iterates through each password stored in a dictionary \\nuntil one works or until the cracker comes to the end of the dictionary.\\nThe syntax for creating a dictionary is as follows:\\ndict = { key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3...}\\nNote that for dictionaries, you use curly brackets and separate items',\n",

There are a number of ways in Python to control the flow of the script.\\nLet’s look at some of these structures in Python.\\nThe if Statement\\nThe if structure in Python, as in many other programming languages \\nincluding bash, is used to check whether a condition is true or not and \\nrun different sets of code for each scenario. The syntax looks like this:\\nif  conditional  expression :\\n    run this code if the expression is true\\nThe if statement contains a condition that might be something like \\nif variable  < 10 , for example. If the condition is met, the expression evaluates \\nto true, and then the code that follows, known as the control block , is executed. 198   Chapter 17If the statement evaluates to false, then the statements in the control block \\nare skipped over and not executed.',\n",
              " 'In Python, lines that introduce a control block must end with a colon, \\nand the control block must be indented. This indentation identifies the \\ncontrol block to the interpreter. The next statement that is not indented is \\noutside the control block and therefore not part of the if statement, and \\nthis is how Python knows where to skip to if the condition is not met.\\nif...else\\nThe if...else  structure in Python looks like this:\\nif conditional  expression :\\n    *** # run this code when the condition is met\\nelse:\\n    *** # run this code when the condition is not met\\nAs before, first the interpreter checks the condition in the if expres \\xad\\nsion. If it evaluates to true, the interpreter executes the statements in the \\ncontrol block. If the conditional statement evaluates to false, the control \\nblock following the else statement is executed instead.\\nFor example, here we have a code snippet that checks the value of a user',\n",
              " 'ID; if it is 0 (the root user in Linux is always UID 0), then we print the mes \\xad\\nsage “You are the root user.” Else, if it is any other value, we print the message \\n“You are NOT the root user.”\\nif userid == 0:\\n   print(\"You are the root user\")\\nelse:\\n   print(\"You are NOT the root user\")\\nLoops\\nLoops are another very useful structure in Python. Loops enable the pro \\xad\\ngrammer to repeat a code block multiple times, depending on a value or a \\ncondition. The two kinds of loops are while  and for.\\nThe while Loop\\nThe while  loop evaluates a Boolean expression (an expression that can evalu \\xad\\nate only to true or false) and continues execution while the expression evalu \\xad\\nates to true. For example, we could create a code snippet that prints each \\nnumber from 1 to 10 and then exits the loop, like so:\\ncount = 1\\nwhile (count <= 10):\\n   print(count)\\n   count += 1\\nThe indented control block then runs for as long as the condition is true.Python Scripting Basics for Hackers    199The for Loop',\n",
              " 'The for loop can assign values from a list, string, dictionary, or other iter \\xad\\nable structure to an index variable each time through the loop, allowing us \\nto use each item in the structure one after the other. For example, we can \\nuse a for loop to attempt passwords until we find a match, like so:\\nfor password in passwords:\\n    attempt = connect(username, password)\\n    if attempt == \"230\":\\n       print(\"Password found: \" + password)\\n       sys.exit(0)\\nIn this code snippet, we create a for statement that continues through a \\nlist of passwords we have provided and attempts to connect with a username \\nand password. If the connection attempt receives a 230 code, which is the \\ncode for a successful FTP connection, the program prints \"Password found:\"  \\nand then the password. It then exits.
